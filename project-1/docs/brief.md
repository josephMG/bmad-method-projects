# Project Brief: React Calculator

### Executive Summary
This project will create a modern, web-based calculator application. It will solve the need for a quick, user-friendly calculation tool by providing basic arithmetic functions, an interactive calculation history, and a clean, visually appealing interface. The primary target users are students needing a reliable tool for their studies and casual users who require fast, simple calculations.

### Problem Statement
Users requiring quick calculations in a web browser often face a frustrating choice between clunky, ad-filled calculator sites, or tools that lack intuitive features for multi-step problems. Students, for example, can easily lose their place or make transcription errors when performing long calculations, as most simple calculators don't maintain a clear, usable history. Similarly, casual users who need a fast answer are often presented with poorly designed, non-intuitive interfaces, creating a needlessly negative user experience for a simple task. Existing solutions frequently fail to combine speed, a clean user interface, and thoughtful features into one reliable tool.

### Proposed Solution
We will develop a single-page web application using React that functions as a fast, modern, and beautiful calculator. The core of the solution is to provide not only flawless basic arithmetic operations but also an enhanced user experience through two key differentiators:

1.  **An Interactive History:** A persistent, clear log of all calculations (e.g., "2 + 3 = 5") that allows users to click on past results or full equations to load them back into the calculator for immediate reuse.
2.  **A "Modern Minimalist" UI:** A clean, uncluttered interface that prioritizes ease of use, combined with a vibrant, modern color scheme to make the experience enjoyable.

This solution will succeed by tightly focusing on the specific needs of students and casual users, delivering a polished and purpose-built tool that feels better to use than generic, ad-cluttered alternatives.

### Target Users

**Primary User Segment: The Student**
*   **Profile:** High school or university students engaged in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Math) coursework.
*   **Behaviors & Goals:** They are working on homework or studying for exams. Their goal is to complete multi-step problems accurately and efficiently without losing track of their work.
*   **Needs & Pain Points:** They need to easily reference and reuse previous calculations to avoid manual transcription errors. They are often frustrated by basic calculators that have no memory or history.

**Secondary User Segment: The Casual User**
*   **Profile:** Any general internet user on a desktop or mobile device.
*   **Behaviors & Goals:** They are browsing the web and encounter a situation requiring a simple, one-off calculation (e.g., splitting a bill, calculating a discount, or a quick sum). Their goal is to get a correct answer with minimal time and effort.
*   **Needs & Pain Points:** They need a calculator that loads instantly and is immediately intuitive. They are deterred by cluttered, ugly interfaces and ads, which create unnecessary friction for a simple task.

### Goals & Success Metrics

**Business Objectives**
*   Successfully deliver a functional calculator web application that meets all requirements outlined in the prompt.
*   Deploy the application successfully using Docker, proving the viability of the containerization strategy.
*   Create a high-quality, portfolio-ready project that showcases modern frontend development and DevOps practices.

**User Success Metrics**
*   **Task Completion (Student):** A user can successfully complete a multi-step calculation by clicking a previous result in the history to use it in a new calculation.
*   **Time-to-Answer (Casual User):** A first-time user can get a correct answer to a simple two-number calculation in under 5 seconds.
*   **Qualitative Feedback:** Users describe the calculator as "clean," "beautiful," "fast," or "easy to use."

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
*(These are hypothetical metrics to track post-launch)*
*   **Feature Engagement:** At least 20% of user sessions involve an interaction with the history panel.
*   **User Satisfaction Score:** Achieve an average rating of 4.5/5 stars or higher from user feedback.
*   **Adoption Rate:** (If deployed publicly) Achieve 100 unique users in the first month.

### MVP Scope

**Core Features (Must Have)**
*   **Basic Arithmetic:** Flawless addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   **Real-time Display:** A clear screen that shows the current number being entered and the ongoing calculation.
*   **Interactive Controls:** Clickable buttons for all numbers (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), equals (=), and a clear (C/CE) function.
*   **Keyboard Support:** The ability to perform calculations using the computer keyboard for speed.
*   **Interactive History Panel:** The history list we defined, where clicking a past entry reuses it in the current calculation.
*   **Modern Minimalist UI:** The clean, colorful, and uncluttered interface we discussed.

**Out of Scope for MVP**
*   Scientific functions (e.g., trigonometry, logarithms).
*   Programmer-focused functions (e.g., HEX/BIN conversions).
*   Unit or currency conversions.
*   Traditional memory functions (M+, M-, MR), as the history panel provides a more advanced alternative.
*   User accounts or saving history between visits.
*   Themes or other customization options.

**MVP Success Criteria**
The MVP will be considered a success when all core features are implemented and bug-free, the application can be started reliably with a single `docker-compose up` command, and the UI is responsive and usable on standard desktop and mobile web browsers.

### Post-MVP Vision

**Phase 2 Features**
*   Once the MVP is successful, the next priorities will be to introduce:
    *   **Scientific Functions:** A toggle or separate mode for trigonometric and logarithmic functions.
    *   **Traditional Memory Functions:** Add M+, M-, and MR capabilities for users accustomed to that workflow.
    *   **Themes:** Introduce theming capabilities, such as a "dark mode" and potentially other color schemes.

**Long-term Vision**
*   The long-term vision is for the calculator to evolve from a simple utility into a comprehensive, highly-rated calculation platform that is the go-to choice for both everyday and specialized calculations in the browser.

### Technical Considerations

**Platform Requirements**
*   **Target Platforms:** Modern desktop and mobile web browsers.
*   **Performance Requirements:** The application should load quickly and feel responsive during calculations.

**Technology Preferences**
*   **Frontend:** React (latest version)
*   **Component Library:** Material-UI
*   **Development Environment:** Node.js (version 24+)
*   **Styling:** (Handled by Material-UI)
*   **Hosting/Infrastructure:** The project must be deployable via a `docker-compose.yml` file, which will manage the application container (and an optional Nginx container for serving).

**Architecture Considerations**
*   **Structure:** A component-based architecture (e.g., `Display`, `Keypad`, `Button` components).
*   **State Management:** Utilize core React hooks like `useState` and `useEffect`.
*   **Deployment:** The final output must include a `Dockerfile` for the React app and the `docker-compose.yml` for orchestration.

### Constraints & Assumptions

**Constraints**
*   **Technology Stack:** The use of React, Node.js (24+), Material-UI, and Docker/Docker-Compose is a fixed requirement.
*   **Project Scope:** The scope is strictly limited to the features defined in the MVP. Any additional features are postponed until after the MVP is delivered.
*   **Team:** The project will be executed by the BMAD agent team.

**Key Assumptions**
*   We assume users will prefer the interactive history panel over traditional memory functions (M+, MR), justifying the exclusion of the latter from the MVP.
*   We assume a clean, modern, and aesthetically pleasing UI is a key driver of adoption and satisfaction for casual users.
*   We assume that the application does not need to persist history between browser sessions for the MVP to be valuable.
*   We assume users will be on modern web browsers that can support the latest version of React.

### Risks & Open Questions

**Key Risks**
*   **Risk:** The "modern minimalist" design is subjective and might require a few iterations to get right. **Mitigation:** The UX Expert should produce simple mockups for approval before development begins.
*   **Risk:** Calculator logic, especially handling edge cases (like division by zero, repeated operators, etc.), can be more complex than it appears. **Mitigation:** The QA agent must develop a thorough test plan covering these edge cases.
*   **Risk:** The temptation of "scope creep" could delay the MVP. **Mitigation:** The Project Manager must strictly adhere to the agreed-upon MVP scope.

**Open Questions**
*   What is the desired behavior for calculations that result in very large numbers that don't fit on the screen? (e.g., scientific notation?)
*   What is the specific color palette we want to use for the light and dark themes?
*   How should the application handle invalid inputs, like "1++2"?

### Next Steps

**Immediate Actions**
1.  Finalize and distribute this Project Brief to all team members.
2.  The Project Manager (PM) will use this brief to begin creating the Product Requirements Document (PRD) and user stories.
3.  The Architect will begin designing the component structure and Docker setup based on the technical considerations.

**PM Handoff**
This Project Brief provides the full context for the Calculator Project. The Project Manager should now begin their process, reviewing this brief thoroughly to create the PRD, epics, and stories, asking for any necessary clarification and suggesting improvements.
