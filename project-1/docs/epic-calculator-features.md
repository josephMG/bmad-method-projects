# Advanced Calculator Features - Brownfield Enhancement

## Epic Goal

This epic will add a Scientific Calculator and a Currency Exchange Calculator to the application, providing users with more advanced calculation tools accessible via new routes.

## Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

- **Current relevant functionality:** The application has a single page displaying a basic calculator. The implementation is incomplete, as the UI components are not yet created.
- **Technology stack:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Material-UI, and React Router.
- **Integration points:** The new calculators will be integrated into the existing React application via new routes using React Router.

**Enhancement Details:**

- **What's being added/changed:**
  - A new Scientific Calculator feature, including functions like logarithms, trigonometry, and exponentiation.
  - A new Currency Exchange Calculator for converting between TWD, JPY, USD, and KRW using fixed rates.
  - New routes (`/scientific`, `/currency`) for the new calculators.
  - Navigation elements (e.g., a menu or links) to switch between the different calculators.
- **How it integrates:** New components for the calculators will be created. New routes will be added to `App.tsx` to render these components.
- **Success criteria:**
  - A user can navigate to a `/scientific` route and use the scientific calculator.
  - A user can navigate to a `/currency` route and use the currency exchange calculator.
  - The UI is consistent with the existing application design.

## Stories

1.  **Story 1: Implement Scientific Calculator Feature:** Create the UI and logic for the scientific calculator, including advanced mathematical functions. The component will be self-contained and ready for routing.
2.  **Story 2: Implement Currency Exchange Calculator Feature:** Create the UI and logic for the currency exchange calculator with pre-defined rates for TWD, JPY, USD, and KRW.
3.  **Story 3: Add Routing and Navigation for New Calculators:** Add new routes for the scientific and currency exchange calculators in `App.tsx`. Implement a navigation component to allow users to switch between the basic, scientific, and currency exchange calculators.

## Compatibility Requirements

- [X] Existing APIs remain unchanged
- [X] Database schema changes are backward-compatible (N/A)
- [X] UI changes follow existing patterns (Material-UI)
- [X] Performance impact is minimal

## Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** Introducing complexity that conflicts with the yet-to-be-completed basic calculator.
- **Mitigation:** The new features will be developed as separate, isolated components on new routes, minimizing impact on the existing (and incomplete) calculator page.
- **Rollback Plan:** Deactivate the new routes in `App.tsx` and remove the new component files.

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All stories completed with acceptance criteria met.
- [ ] Existing functionality verified through testing (manual for now).
- [ ] Integration points (routing) working correctly.
- [ ] No regression in the root calculator page.
