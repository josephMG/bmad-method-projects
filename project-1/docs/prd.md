# React Calculator Product Requirements Document (PRD)

### 1. Goals and Background Context

**Goals**
*   To deliver a fast, beautiful, and easy-to-use web-based calculator.
*   To provide a superior user experience for students through an interactive calculation history.
*   To create a visually appealing tool that casual users will enjoy using for simple calculations.
*   To successfully package and deploy the application using Docker Compose.

**Background Context**
This project addresses a gap in the market for a web-based calculator that successfully combines functionality, usability, and modern aesthetics. While many calculators exist, they are often cluttered, poorly designed, or lack features for more involved, multi-step calculations. This PRD defines the requirements for an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that will serve as a polished, portfolio-quality application demonstrating modern frontend and DevOps practices. It is built upon the foundation and key decisions established in the Project Brief.

### 2. Requirements

**Functional Requirements**
*   **FR1:** The system must provide the four basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   **FR2:** The system must display the numbers being entered, the current operator, and the running calculation in real time.
*   **FR3:** The system must support user input via both on-screen button clicks and physical keyboard entry.
*   **FR4:** The system must maintain a visible history of past calculations (equation and result).
*   **FR5:** The system must allow a user to click on an entry in the calculation history to load it for use in the current calculation.
*   **FR6:** The system must provide a "Clear" function to reset the current calculation.

**Non-Functional Requirements**
*   **NFR1:** The user interface must be clean, modern, and visually appealing, following a "modern minimalist" aesthetic using the Material-UI library.
*   **NFR2:** The application must be fully responsive and usable on both standard desktop and mobile web browsers.
*   **NFR3:** The application must load quickly and feel responsive, with calculations appearing instantaneously.

### 3. User Interface Design Goals

**Overall UX Vision**
The user experience will be defined by simplicity and elegance. The goal is a "distraction-free" calculation environment that feels intuitive from the very first use. The design should be clean and modern, making the calculator not just a tool, but a pleasant application to interact with.

**Key Interaction Paradigms**
*   **Single Page Application:** The entire experience is contained within a single, fast-loading page. No reloads or navigation.
*   **Real-time Feedback:** Every button press provides immediate visual feedback on the main display.
*   **Direct Manipulation:** Users interact directly with calculator buttons and the history panel.

**Core Screens and Views**
*   **Main Calculator View:** A single screen containing the display, the keypad, and the history panel.

**Accessibility**
*   The application should adhere to **WCAG AA** standards, ensuring it is usable by people with a wide range of disabilities.

**Branding**
*   The aesthetic is "Modern Minimalist." While there is no formal style guide, the design should use a clean layout, legible fonts, and a vibrant, modern color palette, as decided in the project brief. The specific colors will be determined by the UX Expert.

**Target Device and Platforms**
*   **Web Responsive:** The application must provide a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile web browsers.

### 4. Technical Assumptions

**Repository Structure**
*   **Monorepo:** The entire project (React frontend, Docker files, etc.) will be contained within a single Git repository.

**Service Architecture**
*   **Monolith:** The application is a single, client-side React application and does not require a microservices or serverless architecture.

**Testing Requirements**
*   **Unit + Integration:** The project should include unit tests for individual components and logic, as well as integration tests to ensure they work together correctly.

**Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests**
*   **Frontend Framework:** React (latest version)
*   **Component Library:** Material-UI
*   **Development Environment:** Node.js 24+
*   **State Management:** Core React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) are sufficient for this project's needs.
*   **Deployment:** The application must be containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Docker Compose.

### 5. Epic List

*   **Epic 1: Foundational UI & Core Components:** Establish the project structure, build the main user interface with all visual components (Display, Keypad, History Panel) using Material-UI, and ensure the application is runnable via Docker Compose. This epic delivers a visually complete, clickable, but non-functional calculator.
*   **Epic 2: Calculation Engine & Interactive History:** Implement the core calculation logic to handle all arithmetic operations and bring the calculator to life. Implement the full functionality for the interactive history panel, allowing users to view and reuse past calculations.

### 6. Epic 1: Foundational UI & Core Components

**Epic Goal:** The goal of this epic is to create the complete, visually accurate, and responsive user interface for the calculator. This includes initializing the project, setting up Docker, and building all static UI components with Material-UI. The result will be a deployable, clickable, but non-functional application that perfectly matches our "Modern Minimalist" design vision.

**Story 1.1: Project Initialization**
*   **As a** Developer,
*   **I want** a new React project created with Material-UI and a working Docker-compose setup,
*   **so that** I have a runnable and deployable foundation for building the calculator application.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A new React application is created.
2.  Material-UI is installed and configured correctly.
3.  A `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` are created.
4.  The command `docker-compose up` successfully builds and runs the application.
5.  The running application displays a simple "Hello World" or placeholder page.

**Story 1.2: Application Layout & Display Component**
*   **As a** User,
*   **I want** to see the main calculator layout with a display screen,
*   **so that** I can view the numbers I will type and the results of my calculations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  The main application layout is created, with placeholders for a display, a keypad, and a history panel.
2.  A `Display` component is created.
3.  The `Display` component correctly shows a default value (e.g., "0").
4.  The component is styled according to the "Modern Minimalist" aesthetic using Material-UI components.

**Story 1.3: Keypad Component**
*   **As a** User,
*   **I want** to see a keypad with buttons for all numbers (0-9) and operators (+, -, *, /, =),
*   **so that** I can input my calculations.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A `Keypad` component is created.
2.  The keypad contains distinct, clickable buttons for numbers 0-9.
3.  The keypad contains distinct, clickable buttons for operators +, -, *, /, and =.
4.  A "Clear" button is present.
5.  All buttons are styled using Material-UI and match the application's aesthetic. Clicking the buttons does not need to do anything yet.

**Story 1.4: History Panel Component**
*   **As a** User,
*   **I want** to see a panel where my calculation history will appear,
*   **so that** I can reference my previous work.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  A `History` component is created and placed in the main layout.
2.  The panel displays placeholder text or a sample list of past calculations (e.g., "2+2=4", "5*3=15").
3.  The panel is styled using Material-UI to match the application's aesthetic.

### 7. Epic 2: Calculation Engine & Interactive History

**Epic Goal:** This epic will implement the "brains" of the calculator. We will develop the logic for performing all arithmetic operations, manage the calculator's state, and enable the fully interactive history feature. By the end of this epic, the static UI from Epic 1 will be transformed into a complete, functional, and deployable application.

**Story 2.1: Number Input & Display**
*   **As a** User,
*   **I want** the numbers I click on the keypad (or type on my keyboard) to appear and update on the display,
*   **so that** I can see the numbers I am entering for my calculation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  Clicking a number button (0-9) on the keypad updates the main display with that number.
2.  Subsequent number clicks append to the number on the display (e.g., clicking 1 then 2 shows "12").
3.  Typing a number key on the physical keyboard produces the same result as clicking the on-screen button.

**Story 2.2: Operator & Calculation State**
*   **As a** User,
*   **I want** to be able to select an operator (+, -, *, /) after entering a number,
*   **so that** I can prepare for the second part of my calculation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  After entering a number, clicking an operator button stores the first number and the selected operator in the application's state.
2.  The display is cleared, ready for the second number to be entered.
3.  Typing an operator key on the physical keyboard produces the same result.

**Story 2.3: Perform Calculation**
*   **As a** User,
*   **I want** to press the '=' button after entering a second number to see the correct result,
*   **so that** I can get the answer to my calculation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  Pressing '=' executes the stored operation (e.g., first number + second number).
2.  The result is displayed correctly on the screen.
3.  The system correctly handles division by zero by showing an error message (e.g., "Error").
4.  Pressing the 'Enter' key on the physical keyboard triggers the calculation, same as the '=' button.

**Story 2.4: Clear Functionality**
*   **As a** User,
*   **I want** the 'Clear' button to reset the calculator to its initial state,
*   **so that** I can start a fresh calculation at any time.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  Clicking the 'Clear' button resets any stored numbers and operators.
2.  The display is reset to its default state (e.g., "0").

**Story 2.5: Update History**
*   **As a** User,
*   **I want** my completed calculations to be automatically added to the top of the history panel,
*   **so that** I have a persistent record of my work within the session.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  After a calculation is successfully completed (via the '=' button), the full equation and its result (e.g., "12 + 5 = 17") is added as a new entry to the `History` component.
2.  New entries appear at the top of the list.

**Story 2.6: Interactive History**
*   **As a** User,
*   **I want** to be able to click on any entry in the history panel,
*   **so that** I can load its result back into the display to use in a new calculation.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1.  Clicking on a history item's text or a dedicated "reuse" button next to it updates the main display with the result from that historical calculation.
2.  The calculator is ready to use that number as the first number in a new calculation.
