# 1. Goals and Background Context

## 1.1. Product Vision/Overall Goal:
To develop a clean, intuitive, and feature-rich iOS calculator app that mirrors the user experience of the native iOS calculator. This project will serve as a foundational portfolio piece, demonstrating core competencies in SwiftUI, modern architectural patterns, and the complete app development lifecycle, from concept to a store-ready product.

## 1.2. Target Audience:
General Users: People who need a simple, reliable tool for everyday calculations like budgeting, shopping, or quick math problems.

## 1.3. Key High-Level Features (to be detailed in subsequent sections):
*   Core Operations (Portrait Mode): Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Percentage (%), Sign Change (+/âˆ’), All Clear (AC) / Clear (C) functionality.
*   Scientific Functions (Landscape Mode): Includes all core operations and adds advanced functions (e.g., trigonometric functions, logarithms, square roots, etc.).
*   User Interface & Experience (UI/UX): Clean, minimalist design inspired by the native iOS Calculator. Responsive layout that automatically switches between modes on device rotation.
*   Technical Foundation: Built using the latest iOS SDK and SwiftUI. Includes comprehensive unit and basic UI tests. Adheres to all Apple App Store guidelines.
*   Currency Exchange: Convert between TWD, USD, JPY, KRW with constant rates.

## 1.4. Key Non-Functional Requirements:
*   **Performance:** Quick launch (<2s), instantaneous calculations, and a smooth, responsive UI.
*   **Accuracy:** 100% accurate mathematical calculations.
*   **Usability:** Highly intuitive, requiring no instructions.
*   **Compatibility:** Supports the latest two major iOS versions and all standard iPhone screen sizes.

## 1.5. Success Metrics:
*   **Project Completion:** The app is fully built to spec.
*   **App Store Readiness:** The app successfully passes the App Store review process.
*   **Technical Proficiency:** The codebase is clean, well-documented, and demonstrates a strong understanding of SwiftUI and testing.
*   **Functionality:** The app operates without bugs or crashes.
*   **Test Coverage:** Unit tests cover >90% of critical calculation logic.

## 1.6. Project Timeline/Milestones:
*   **M1 (Weeks 1-2):** Project Kick-off & Design (PRD, Architecture, Backlog).
*   **M2 (Weeks 3-4):** Core App Development (Portrait Mode UI, Calc Engine, Unit Tests).
*   **M3 (Weeks 5-6):** Scientific Features & UI Polish (Landscape Mode, Advanced Functions, Rotation Logic).
*   **M4 (Week 7):** Testing & App Store Preparation (E2E Testing, Bug Fixes, Asset Creation).
*   **M5 (Week 8):** Submission & Release.

## 1.7. Key Risks and Mitigation Strategies:
*   **Technical Hurdles:** Mitigated by following a strict architecture plan and allocating time for research.
*   **Scope Creep:** Mitigated by adhering strictly to this PRD for version 1.
*   **App Store Rejection:** Mitigated by proactively reviewing Apple's guidelines throughout development.
*   **Design Complexity:** Mitigated by prioritizing function over pixel-perfect cloning of complex native animations.
