# 2. Problem Statement

## 2.1. The Problem:
Users often seek a calculator application on iOS that is both highly functional for everyday and scientific calculations, and aesthetically aligned with the native iOS user experience. Existing alternatives may fall short in terms of design consistency, intuitive interaction, or comprehensive feature sets, leading to a fragmented or less satisfying user experience.

## 2.2. Impact of the Problem:
Without a well-designed and feature-rich calculator, users may resort to less efficient methods for calculations, switch between multiple apps for different types of math, or feel a disconnect from the overall iOS ecosystem due to inconsistent UI/UX. This can lead to frustration, reduced productivity, and a less cohesive mobile experience.
