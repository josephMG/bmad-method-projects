# 3. User Stories / Use Cases

## 3.1. Core Operations (Portrait Mode):

*   **As a general user, I want to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) so that I can quickly solve everyday math problems.**
    *   *Acceptance Criteria:*
        *   User can input numbers and operators.
        *   App displays the current input and result accurately.
        *   App correctly calculates the result of the operation.
*   **As a general user, I want to calculate percentages so that I can easily figure out discounts, tips, or proportions.**
    *   *Acceptance Criteria:*
        *   User can input a number, then the percentage operator, and another number (e.g., 50 + 10%).
        *   App correctly calculates the percentage of a number or adds/subtracts a percentage.
*   **As a general user, I want to change the sign of a number (+/âˆ’) so that I can work with positive and negative values.**
    *   *Acceptance Criteria:*
        *   User can toggle the sign of the currently displayed number.
        *   App updates the displayed number with the correct sign.
*   **As a general user, I want to clear the current input (C) or all input (AC) so that I can correct mistakes or start a new calculation.**
    *   *Acceptance Criteria:*
        *   Pressing 'C' clears the last entered number or operation.
        *   Pressing 'AC' clears all input and resets the calculator.

## 3.2. Scientific Functions (Dedicated View):

*   **As a power user, I want to access advanced mathematical functions (e.g., trigonometric, logarithmic, square root) in a dedicated scientific calculator view so that I can perform complex scientific or engineering calculations without cluttering the basic calculator interface.**
    *   *Acceptance Criteria:*
        *   A clear mechanism (e.g., a button or mode switch) is provided to navigate to the scientific calculator view.
        *   The scientific calculator view presents all advanced functions.
        *   User can input numbers and apply scientific functions within this dedicated view.
        *   App correctly calculates the result of scientific operations.
        *   The scientific calculator view operates independently of the basic calculator view.

## 3.3. User Interface & Experience:

*   **As a user, I want the calculator's design to be clean and intuitive, similar to the native iOS calculator, so that I can use it without needing instructions.**
    *   *Acceptance Criteria:*
        *   The app's layout and button placement are familiar to native iOS users.
        *   Visual feedback is provided for button presses.
*   **As a user, I want the app to automatically switch between portrait (basic) and landscape (scientific) modes when I rotate my device, so that I can seamlessly access different functionalities.**
    *   *Acceptance Criteria:*
        *   Rotating the device from portrait to landscape displays scientific functions.
        *   Rotating the device from landscape to portrait displays basic functions.
