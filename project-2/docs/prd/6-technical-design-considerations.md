# 6. Technical Design Considerations

## 6.1. Architecture Pattern

*   **TDC1: VIPER Architecture:** The application SHALL adopt the VIPER (View, Interactor, Presenter, Entity, Router) architectural pattern.
    *   **Rationale:** VIPER promotes a clean separation of concerns, making the codebase more modular, testable, and maintainable. This is particularly beneficial for a foundational portfolio piece where demonstrating strong architectural principles is a key success metric.
    *   **Components:**
        *   **View:** Responsible for displaying the UI and forwarding user input to the Presenter. (e.g., `CalculatorView.swift`)
        *   **Interactor:** Contains the business logic and data manipulation. It interacts with Entities and provides data to the Presenter. (e.g., `CalculatorInteractor.swift`)
        *   **Presenter:** Acts as a mediator between the View and the Interactor. It receives input from the View, requests data from the Interactor, and formats data for the View. (e.g., `CalculatorPresenter.swift`)
        *   **Entity:** Represents the data models used by the application. (e.g., `CalculatorEntity.swift`)
        *   **Router:** Handles navigation between different modules/screens. (e.g., `CalculatorRouter.swift`)

## 6.2. Technology Stack

*   **TDC2: iOS SDK & SwiftUI:** The application SHALL be built exclusively using the latest available iOS SDK and SwiftUI for UI development.
    *   **Rationale:** Aligns with the Project Brief's goal of demonstrating core competencies in SwiftUI and leveraging modern iOS development practices.
*   **TDC3: Swift Programming Language:** All application logic SHALL be written in Swift.
    *   **Rationale:** Standard for iOS development, offering safety, performance, and modern language features.

## 6.3. Core Logic Implementation

*   **TDC4: Calculation Engine:** A dedicated, robust calculation engine SHALL be implemented within the Interactor layer to handle all arithmetic and scientific operations.
    *   **Rationale:** Centralizing calculation logic ensures accuracy, consistency, and simplifies testing. It also allows for easier updates or extensions of mathematical functions.
    *   **Considerations:**
        *   Handling of floating-point precision to avoid common errors.
        *   Order of operations (PEMDAS/BODMAS) for complex expressions.
        *   Error handling for invalid operations (e.g., division by zero, invalid input for scientific functions).

## 6.4. UI/UX Implementation

*   **TDC5: Adaptive Layout & View Separation:** SwiftUI's layout system SHALL be utilized to create a responsive UI that adapts to different device orientations (portrait/landscape) and screen sizes. The Scientific Calculator SHALL reside in a dedicated, separate view, accessible via a clear navigation mechanism, and SHALL NOT be mixed with the traditional calculator interface.
    *   **Rationale:** Directly addresses the requirement for seamless mode switching and broad device compatibility, while ensuring a clean separation of concerns for different calculator modes as explicitly requested by the user.
*   **TDC6: Native-like Experience:** Custom SwiftUI views and modifiers SHALL be designed to mimic the visual appearance and interaction patterns of the native iOS calculator.
    *   **Rationale:** Fulfills the product vision of mirroring the native iOS user experience.

## 6.5. Testing Strategy

*   **TDC7: Unit Testing:** Unit tests SHALL be written for all critical business logic within the Interactor and Entity layers, aiming for >90% coverage of calculation logic.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures mathematical accuracy and reliability of the core functionality.
*   **TDC8: UI Testing:** Basic UI tests SHALL be implemented to verify key user flows and UI responsiveness across different orientations.
    *   **Rationale:** Confirms that the user interface behaves as expected and adapts correctly.

## 6.6. Version Control & CI/CD

*   **TDC9: Git for Version Control:** Git SHALL be used for source code management.
*   **TDC10: CI/CD Pipeline:** A Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline SHALL be set up to automate builds, run tests, and facilitate deployment.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures code quality, speeds up development cycles, and supports the "App Store Readiness" success metric.
