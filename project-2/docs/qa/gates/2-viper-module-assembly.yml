  - title: 'Missing Code Implementation'
    severity: high
    description: 'The story describes the architectural setup, but no code has been provided for review. A full quality assessment is impossible without the implementation.'

  - title: 'Missing Test Evidence'
    severity: high
    description: 'No unit or UI tests have been provided to verify the protocol definitions, module assembly, or application launch as per acceptance criteria.'

  security:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Not directly applicable at this stage, but future security reviews will be critical once data handling and communication are implemented.'
  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Initial module assembly should be efficient, but actual performance can only be assessed with code. No specific performance concerns identified at this stubbed stage.'
  reliability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Error handling and recovery mechanisms cannot be assessed without code implementation. This will be a key focus in subsequent reviews.'
  maintainability:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: 'Code clarity and documentation cannot be assessed without code. Adherence to VIPER principles will be crucial for maintainability.'
