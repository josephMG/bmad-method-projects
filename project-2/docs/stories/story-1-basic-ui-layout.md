### Story: Basic UI Layout

**Description:** As a user, I want to see a calculator interface with a display screen and a grid of buttons for digits (0-9) and basic operations (+, -, ×, /, =).

**Prerequisites:** None.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   The UI is built using SwiftUI.
*   A `CalculatorView` is created that displays a non-interactive grid of buttons for numbers 0-9, operators (+, -, ×, /), equals (=), and clear (C).
*   A display panel is present at the top of the view, initially showing "0".
*   The layout is clean, functional, and usable in portrait mode.
