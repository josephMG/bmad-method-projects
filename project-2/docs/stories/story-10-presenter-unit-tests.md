### Story: Presenter Unit Tests

**Description:** As a developer, I need unit tests for the `CalculatorPresenter` to verify its data formatting and gesture handling logic.

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Using mock objects, tests verify that raw `Decimal` values from the Interactor are correctly formatted into strings.
*   Tests verify that calls from the View (e.g., `didTapAdd()`) result in the correct methods being called on the mock Interactor.

**Effort:** 2 Story Points

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Cannot assess without the test code.

### Refactoring Performed
None, as code is not available for review.

### Compliance Check
*   Coding Standards: Cannot verify without the test code.
*   Project Structure: Unit tests should be placed in the `CalculatorTests` directory, likely `CalculatorPresenterTests.swift`.
*   Testing Strategy: This story is a direct implementation of the testing strategy for the `Presenter`.
*   All ACs Met: Cannot verify without the test code.

### Improvements Checklist
*   [ ] Verify the existence and content of `CalculatorPresenterTests.swift`.
*   [ ] Confirm unit tests use mock objects for the `View` and `Interactor` to isolate the `Presenter`.
*   [ ] Confirm tests verify correct formatting of `Decimal` values into strings for display.
*   [ ] Confirm tests verify that `View` actions (e.g., `didTapAdd()`) correctly trigger corresponding methods on the mock `Interactor`.
*   [ ] Ensure test cases cover various input scenarios and formatting edge cases (e.g., large numbers, decimals).
