### Story: Basic UI Tests

**Description:** As a developer, I want basic UI tests to ensure the View components are present and that user interactions produce the expected display updates.

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   An XCUITest target is configured.
*   A UI test verifies that all digit and operator buttons are on the screen.
*   A test simulates a simple calculation (e.g., "1 + 2 =") and asserts that the final display value is "3".

**Effort:** 2 Story Points

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Cannot assess without the test code.

### Refactoring Performed
None, as code is not available for review.

### Compliance Check
*   Coding Standards: Cannot verify without the test code.
*   Project Structure: UI tests should be placed in the `CalculatorUITests` directory, likely `CalculatorUITests.swift`.
*   Testing Strategy: This story is a direct implementation of the testing strategy for the UI.
*   All ACs Met: Cannot verify without the test code.

### Improvements Checklist
*   [ ] Verify the existence and configuration of an XCUITest target.
*   [ ] Confirm a UI test verifies the presence of all digit and operator buttons.
*   [ ] Confirm a UI test simulates a simple calculation (e.g., "1 + 2 = ") and asserts the correct final display value ("3").
*   [ ] Ensure UI tests are robust against UI changes and use appropriate waiting mechanisms.
*   [ ] Consider adding accessibility identifiers to UI elements to make tests more stable.
