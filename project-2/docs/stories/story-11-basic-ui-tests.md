### Story: Basic UI Tests

**Description:** As a developer, I want basic UI tests to ensure the View components are present and that user interactions produce the expected display updates.

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   An XCUITest target is configured.
*   A UI test verifies that all digit and operator buttons are on the screen.
*   A test simulates a simple calculation (e.g., "1 + 2 =") and asserts that the final display value is "3".
