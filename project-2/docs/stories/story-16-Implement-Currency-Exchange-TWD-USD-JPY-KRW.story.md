### Story: Implement Currency Exchange (TWD, USD, JPY, KRW)

**Description:** As a general user, I want to convert amounts between TWD, USD, JPY, and KRW using constant exchange rates, within a dedicated currency exchange view.

**Status:** Closed

**Acceptance Criteria:**

- A clear mechanism (e.g., a button or mode switch) is provided to navigate to the currency exchange view.
- The currency exchange view allows users to select a source currency (TWD, USD, JPY, KRW) and a target currency (TWD, USD, JPY, KRW).
- User can input an amount in the source currency.
- App correctly calculates and displays the converted amount in the target currency using predefined constant rates.
- The currency exchange view operates independently of the basic and scientific calculator views.
- App handles invalid inputs (e.g., non-numeric input) gracefully, with tailored error messages.

### Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs.

**Data Models**:

- A new `Currency` enum will be needed to represent TWD, USD, JPY, KRW.
- A data structure (e.g., a dictionary or struct) will be needed to store the constant exchange rates between these currencies.
- `CalculationState` (or a new `CurrencyExchangeState` struct) will need to manage the selected currencies, input amount, and converted amount.
- `Operation` enum (or a new `CurrencyOperation` enum) might need a case for currency conversion.
- `CalculationError` enum (or a new `CurrencyError` enum) will need specific cases tailored to errors related to currency exchange (e.g., `invalidCurrencyInput`).

**API Specifications**: No specific guidance found in architecture docs (not applicable for this internal calculation story, as rates are constant).

**Component Specifications**:

- A dedicated `CurrencyExchangeView` will need to be created to house the currency conversion functionality. This view will be separate from the `CalculatorView` and `ScientificCalculatorView`.
- The `CurrencyExchangeView` will need UI elements for selecting source/target currencies, inputting amounts, and displaying results.
- A new `CurrencyExchangePresenter` will be needed to handle user interactions (e.g., `didSelectSourceCurrency()`, `didEnterAmount()`, `didSelectTargetCurrency()`) and translate them to a `CurrencyExchangeInteractor`.
- The `CurrencyExchangePresenter` will be responsible for formatting the display of currency amounts.
- A mechanism for navigating to and from the `CurrencyExchangeView` will be required, likely managed by the `Router`.

**File Locations**:

- `Calculator/Modules/CurrencyExchange/CurrencyExchangeView.swift`: New SwiftUI View for currency exchange.
- `Calculator/Modules/CurrencyExchange/CurrencyExchangeInteractor.swift`: New Interactor for currency exchange business logic.
- `Calculator/Modules/CurrencyExchange/CurrencyExchangePresenter.swift`: New Presenter for currency exchange view logic and formatting.
- `Calculator/Modules/CurrencyExchange/CurrencyExchangeEntity.swift`: New Entity for currency exchange data models.
- `Calculator/Modules/CurrencyExchange/CurrencyExchangeRouter.swift`: New Router for currency exchange module navigation.
- `Calculator/Modules/CurrencyExchange/CurrencyExchangeContract.swift`: New Protocols for currency exchange component interfaces.
- `Calculator/Modules/Calculator/CalculatorRouter.swift`: Will need updates to handle navigation to the `CurrencyExchangeView`.
  [Source: architecture.md#Folder Structure, architecture.md#VIPER Component Breakdown]

**Testing Requirements**:

- **Interactor (Unit Tests with XCTest):**
  - Test currency conversion logic for all supported currency pairs with various amounts.
  - Test edge cases (e.g., converting zero, very large/small amounts).
  - Assert that the correct `CalculationError` (or `CurrencyError`) is produced, with tailored error messages, when invalid operations occur.
- **Presenter (Unit Tests with XCTest):**
  - Test that user interactions (e.g., selecting currencies, entering amounts) correctly call the Interactor's methods.
  - Test that converted amounts from the Interactor are correctly formatted for display.
- **View (UI Tests with XCUITest):**
  _ Verify the presence and functionality of currency selection elements and input/output fields in the `CurrencyExchangeView`.
  _ Simulate currency conversions and assert the final displayed values. \* Test navigation to and from the `CurrencyExchangeView`.

**Technical Constraints**:

- High decimal precision will be maintained internally and displayed to the user, leveraging the `Decimal` type.
- Storage of constant exchange rates (e.g., hardcoded in the Interactor or a dedicated `ExchangeRateProvider`).
- Error handling for invalid currency inputs will be tailored to each specific function and error condition.
