# Story 17: Implement Calculator Mode Switching

## Status: Closed

## 1. Story

**As a user, I want to easily switch between the Basic Calculator, Scientific Calculator, and Currency Exchange modules so that I can access all the application's features from the main screen.**

## 2. Acceptance Criteria

1.  The main calculator view MUST display distinct buttons or controls to navigate to the "Scientific Calculator" and "Currency Exchange" modules.
2.  When the "Scientific" navigation control is tapped, the application MUST present the Scientific Calculator module modally.
3.  When the "Currency Exchange" navigation control is tapped, the application MUST present the Currency Exchange module modally.
4.  The presented Scientific Calculator and Currency Exchange modules MUST be fully functional and self-contained.
5.  There MUST be a clear and conventional iOS mechanism (e.g., swiping down) to dismiss the presented modules and return to the main calculator view.

## 3. Dev Notes

This story formalizes the implementation of the navigation between the primary `Calculator` module and its sub-modules (`ScientificCalculator`, `CurrencyExchange`). The implementation should strictly follow the existing VIPER architecture.

### 3.1. Technical Guidance (from `docs/architecture.md`)

- **Architecture Pattern:** VIPER. The navigation logic is owned by the Router component.
  - [Source: `docs/architecture.md#3-detailed-architecture---viper`]
- **Interaction Flow:**
  1.  **View (`CalculatorView.swift`):** The UI controls (Buttons) for "Scientific" and "Currency" will trigger actions.
  2.  **Presenter (`CalculatorPresenter.swift`):** The view's actions will call corresponding methods on the presenter, such as `didTapScientificCalculator()` and `didTapCurrencyExchange()`.
  3.  **Router (`CalculatorRouter.swift`):** The presenter will then invoke the router to handle the navigation. The router is responsible for creating and presenting the new modules.
- **Module Creation & Presentation:**
  - The `CalculatorRouter` will use the respective routers of the sub-modules to create their full VIPER stacks (e.g., `ScientificCalculatorRouter.createModule()`).
  - The newly created module's `UIViewController` will be presented modally over the current view controller.
  - This approach ensures the modules remain fully decoupled.
  - [Source: `docs/architecture.md#31-module-interaction-and-navigation`]

### 3.2. File Locations

- `CalculatorApp/Calculator/CalculatorView.swift`: UI implementation.
- `CalculatorApp/Calculator/CalculatorPresenter.swift`: Handle tap events.
- `CalculatorApp/Calculator/CalculatorRouter.swift`: Implement presentation logic.

## 4. Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1 (AC: 1):** Verify that the `CalculatorView.swift` contains the UI buttons for "Scientific" and "Currency Exchange".
- [x] **Task 2 (AC: 2):** In `CalculatorPresenter.swift`, ensure the `didTapScientificCalculator()` method correctly calls the `router.presentScientificCalculator()` function.
- [x] **Task 3 (AC: 3):** In `CalculatorPresenter.swift`, ensure the `didTapCurrencyExchange()` method correctly calls the `router.presentCurrencyExchange()` function.
- [x] **Task 4 (AC: 2, 3):** In `CalculatorRouter.swift`, confirm that the `presentScientificCalculator()` and `presentCurrencyExchange()` functions properly instantiate the respective modules using their routers and present them.

## 6. QA Results

- **Review Date:** 2025-09-22
- **Reviewed By:** Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)
- **Gate Status:** PASS
- **Recommended Status:** Closed
- **Comments:** All acceptance criteria for mode switching navigation are met and verified by passing UI tests (`NavigationUITests`). The story is complete as per the DoD checklist.

## 8. Story Definition of Done (DoD) Checklist

### Instructions for Developer Agent

Before marking a story as 'Review', please go through each item in this checklist. Report the status of each item (e.g., [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, [N/A] Not Applicable) and provide brief comments if necessary.

[[LLM: INITIALIZATION INSTRUCTIONS - STORY DOD VALIDATION

This checklist is for DEVELOPER AGENTS to self-validate their work before marking a story complete.

IMPORTANT: This is a self-assessment. Be honest about what's actually done vs what should be done. It's better to identify issues now than have them found in review.

EXECUTION APPROACH:

1. Go through each section systematically
2. Mark items as [x] Done, [ ] Not Done, or [N/A] Not Applicable
3. Add brief comments explaining any [ ] or [N/A] items
4. Be specific about what was actually implemented
5. Flag any concerns or technical debt created

The goal is quality delivery, not just checking boxes.]]

### Checklist Items
