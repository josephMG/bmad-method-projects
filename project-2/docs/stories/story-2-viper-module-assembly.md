### Story: VIPER Module Assembly

**Description:** As a developer, I need the core VIPER module components and their interfaces (protocols) to be defined and assembled so that the application structure is in place.

**Prerequisites:** None.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   A `CalculatorContract.swift` file is created, defining the protocols for communication between View, Presenter, Interactor, and Router.
*   Stubbed-out classes/structs for `CalculatorView`, `CalculatorPresenter`, `CalculatorInteractor`, and `CalculatorRouter` are created.
*   The `CalculatorRouter` is responsible for instantiating and connecting all the components of the module.
*   The application launches and presents the `CalculatorView` via the Router.

**Effort:** 3 Story Points

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Cannot assess without code. The story describes foundational VIPER module assembly. A thorough code review will be essential once the implementation is available to ensure adherence to architectural principles, design patterns, and best practices.

### Refactoring Performed
None, as code is not available for review.

### Compliance Check
*   Coding Standards: Cannot verify without code. Once implemented, ensure the VIPER components follow established coding standards for Swift.
*   Project Structure: Cannot verify without code. The creation of `CalculatorContract.swift` and stubbed VIPER components should align with the defined project structure.
*   Testing Strategy: Unit tests are crucial for verifying protocol definitions and the correct assembly logic within the `CalculatorRouter`. UI tests are necessary to confirm the application launches and presents the `CalculatorView`.
*   All ACs Met: Cannot verify without code/tests.

### Improvements Checklist
*   [ ] Ensure unit tests verify the correct definition of protocols in `CalculatorContract.swift`. (Blocked by Xcode project configuration issue)
*   [ ] Ensure unit tests verify the `CalculatorRouter` correctly instantiates and connects all VIPER components. (Blocked by Xcode project configuration issue)
*   [ ] Ensure UI tests confirm the application launches and presents the `CalculatorView`. (Blocked by Xcode project configuration issue)
*   [x] Verify that stubbed-out classes/structs are indeed created and correctly structured.
*   [x] **CRITICAL**: Provide the implemented code for a comprehensive review. (Testing is blocked by Xcode project configuration issue)

### Agent Model Used
Gemini

### Debug Log References
- `xcodebuild test -project CalculatorApp/Calculator.xcodeproj -scheme CalculatorApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro' -only-testing CalculatorTests/CalculatorRouterTests`: Failed with "xcodebuild: error: The project named "Calculator" does not contain a scheme named "CalculatorApp"."
- `xcodebuild -list -project CalculatorApp/Calculator.xcodeproj`: Identified correct scheme as "Calculator".
- `xcodebuild test -project CalculatorApp/Calculator.xcodeproj -scheme Calculator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro' -only-testing CalculatorTests/CalculatorRouterTests`: Failed with "[MT] IDERunDestination: Supported platforms for the buildables in the current scheme is empty."
- `xcodebuild test -project CalculatorApp/Calculator.xcodeproj -scheme Calculator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro' -only-testing CalculatorTests`: Failed with "[MT] IDERunDestination: Supported platforms for the buildables in the current scheme is empty."
- `xcodebuild test -project CalculatorApp/Calculator.xcodeproj -scheme Calculator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 15 Pro'`: Failed with "[MT] IDERunDestination: Supported platforms for the buildables in the current scheme is empty."

### Completion Notes List
- Implemented `CalculatorContract.swift` with protocols for View, Presenter, Interactor, and Router.
- Confirmed `CalculatorView.swift`, `CalculatorPresenter.swift`, `CalculatorInteractor.swift`, and `CalculatorRouter.swift` exist and conform to the protocols.
- `CalculatorRouter.swift` is responsible for instantiating and connecting all VIPER components, including presenting the SwiftUI `CalculatorView` via a `UIHostingController`.
- Created `CalculatorApp/CalculatorTests/CalculatorRouterTests.swift` for unit testing module assembly.
- Encountered a blocking issue with `xcodebuild` where it reports "Supported platforms for the buildables in the current scheme is empty," preventing the execution of any tests. This issue needs to be resolved at the Xcode project configuration level before testing can proceed.

### File List
- `CalculatorApp/Calculator/CalculatorContract.swift` (modified)
- `CalculatorApp/Calculator/CalculatorView.swift` (existing, confirmed)
- `CalculatorApp/Calculator/CalculatorPresenter.swift` (existing, confirmed)
- `CalculatorApp/Calculator/CalculatorInteractor.swift` (existing, confirmed)
- `CalculatorApp/Calculator/CalculatorRouter.swift` (existing, confirmed)
- `CalculatorApp/CalculatorTests/CalculatorRouterTests.swift` (created)

### Change Log
- **2025-09-23**: Implemented VIPER module assembly code and created initial unit tests. Encountered a blocking Xcode project configuration issue preventing test execution.

### Status
Ready for Review - Blocking issue: Xcode project configuration prevents test execution. QA needs to re-run review after the blocking issue is resolved.

### Security Review
Not directly applicable to this story's current stage (stubbed components). Future security reviews will focus on data handling and communication within the module.

### Performance Considerations
Initial module assembly should be efficient. Performance will be a more significant concern when actual logic and data processing are introduced.

### Files Modified During Review
None.

### Recommended Status
✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above. The primary concern is the lack of concrete test evidence or code to review. A full quality gate cannot be passed without the actual implementation.
