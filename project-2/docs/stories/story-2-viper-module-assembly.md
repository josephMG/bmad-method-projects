### Story: VIPER Module Assembly

**Description:** As a developer, I need the core VIPER module components and their interfaces (protocols) to be defined and assembled so that the application structure is in place.

**Prerequisites:** None.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   A `CalculatorContract.swift` file is created, defining the protocols for communication between View, Presenter, Interactor, and Router.
*   Stubbed-out classes/structs for `CalculatorView`, `CalculatorPresenter`, `CalculatorInteractor`, and `CalculatorRouter` are created.
*   The `CalculatorRouter` is responsible for instantiating and connecting all the components of the module.
*   The application launches and presents the `CalculatorView` via the Router.

**Effort:** 3 Story Points
