### Story: VIPER Module Assembly

**Description:** As a developer, I need the core VIPER module components and their interfaces (protocols) to be defined and assembled so that the application structure is in place.

**Prerequisites:** None.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   A `CalculatorContract.swift` file is created, defining the protocols for communication between View, Presenter, Interactor, and Router.
*   Stubbed-out classes/structs for `CalculatorView`, `CalculatorPresenter`, `CalculatorInteractor`, and `CalculatorRouter` are created.
*   The `CalculatorRouter` is responsible for instantiating and connecting all the components of the module.
*   The application launches and presents the `CalculatorView` via the Router.

**Effort:** 3 Story Points

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Cannot assess without code. The story describes foundational VIPER module assembly. A thorough code review will be essential once the implementation is available to ensure adherence to architectural principles, design patterns, and best practices.

### Refactoring Performed
None, as code is not available for review.

### Compliance Check
*   Coding Standards: Cannot verify without code. Once implemented, ensure the VIPER components follow established coding standards for Swift.
*   Project Structure: Cannot verify without code. The creation of `CalculatorContract.swift` and stubbed VIPER components should align with the defined project structure.
*   Testing Strategy: Unit tests are crucial for verifying protocol definitions and the correct assembly logic within the `CalculatorRouter`. UI tests are necessary to confirm the application launches and presents the `CalculatorView`.
*   All ACs Met: Cannot verify without code/tests.

### Improvements Checklist
*   [ ] Ensure unit tests verify the correct definition of protocols in `CalculatorContract.swift`.
*   [ ] Ensure unit tests verify the `CalculatorRouter` correctly instantiates and connects all VIPER components.
*   [ ] Ensure UI tests confirm the application launches and presents the `CalculatorView`.
*   [ ] Verify that stubbed-out classes/structs are indeed created and correctly structured.
*   [ ] **CRITICAL**: Provide the implemented code and associated tests for a comprehensive review.

### Security Review
Not directly applicable to this story's current stage (stubbed components). Future security reviews will focus on data handling and communication within the module.

### Performance Considerations
Initial module assembly should be efficient. Performance will be a more significant concern when actual logic and data processing are introduced.

### Files Modified During Review
None.

### Recommended Status
✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above. The primary concern is the lack of concrete test evidence or code to review. A full quality gate cannot be passed without the actual implementation.
