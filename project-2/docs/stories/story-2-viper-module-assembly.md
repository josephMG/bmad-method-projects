### Story: VIPER Module Assembly

**Description:** As a developer, I need the core VIPER module components and their interfaces (protocols) to be defined and assembled so that the application structure is in place.

**Prerequisites:** None.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   A `CalculatorContract.swift` file is created, defining the protocols for communication between View, Presenter, Interactor, and Router.
*   Stubbed-out classes/structs for `CalculatorView`, `CalculatorPresenter`, `CalculatorInteractor`, and `CalculatorRouter` are created.
*   The `CalculatorRouter` is responsible for instantiating and connecting all the components of the module.
*   The application launches and presents the `CalculatorView` via the Router.

**Effort:** 3 Story Points

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Cannot assess without code.

### Refactoring Performed
None, as code is not available for review.

### Compliance Check
*   Coding Standards: Cannot verify without code.
*   Project Structure: Cannot verify without code.
*   Testing Strategy: Unit tests should cover protocol definitions and router assembly. UI tests should cover application launch and view presentation.
*   All ACs Met: Cannot verify without code/tests.

### Improvements Checklist
*   [ ] Ensure unit tests verify the correct definition of protocols in `CalculatorContract.swift`.
*   [ ] Ensure unit tests verify the `CalculatorRouter` correctly instantiates and connects all VIPER components.
*   [ ] Ensure UI tests confirm the application launches and presents the `CalculatorView`.
*   [ ] Verify that stubbed-out classes/structs are indeed created.
