### Story: Data Models and Core State

**Description:** As a developer, I need the core data models (Entities) to represent the calculator's state and operations.

**Prerequisites:** Story 2.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   The `CalculatorEntity.swift` file is created.
*   It contains the `CalculationState` struct to hold operands, operations, and the display value.
*   It contains the `Operation` enum for all arithmetic operations.
*   It contains the `CalculationError` enum for potential errors like `divisionByZero`.
*   The `CalculatorInteractor` is updated to hold an instance of `CalculationState`.

**Effort:** 1 Story Point

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Cannot assess without code.

### Refactoring Performed
None, as code is not available for review.

### Compliance Check
*   Coding Standards: Cannot verify without code.
*   Project Structure: Cannot verify without code.
*   Testing Strategy: Unit tests are essential for `CalculatorEntity.swift` and the interaction with `CalculatorInteractor`.
*   All ACs Met: Cannot verify without code/tests.

### Improvements Checklist
*   [ ] Ensure unit tests cover the `CalculationState` struct, including its initial state and state transitions.
*   [ ] Ensure unit tests cover the `Operation` enum, verifying its behavior.
*   [ ] Ensure unit tests cover the `CalculationError` enum, especially for `divisionByZero`.
*   [ ] Verify that the `CalculatorInteractor` correctly holds and interacts with `CalculationState`.
*   [ ] Consider immutability for `CalculationState` if appropriate, to simplify state management.
