### Story: Displaying Digit Input

**Description:** As a user, when I tap a digit button, I want to see that number appear on the display.

**Prerequisites:** Stories 1, 2, 3.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Tapping a digit button on the `CalculatorView` forwards the action to the Presenter.
*   The Presenter instructs the Interactor to append the digit.
*   The Interactor updates its `CalculationState` and informs the Presenter of the new display value.
*   The Presenter formats the value into a string and updates the `displayText` property bound to the View.
*   The `CalculatorView` updates to show the correct sequence of digits (e.g., tapping "1", then "2", then "3" shows "123").

**Effort:** 3 Story Points

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Cannot assess without code.

### Refactoring Performed
None, as code is not available for review.

### Compliance Check
*   Coding Standards: Cannot verify without code.
*   Project Structure: Cannot verify without code.
*   Testing Strategy: Unit tests are crucial for Presenter and Interactor logic. UI tests are essential for verifying the visual display.
*   All ACs Met: Cannot verify without code/tests.

### Improvements Checklist
*   [ ] Ensure unit tests verify the Presenter correctly forwards digit input to the Interactor.
*   [ ] Ensure unit tests verify the Interactor correctly updates `CalculationState` with appended digits.
*   [ ] Ensure unit tests verify the Presenter correctly formats and updates the `displayText`.
*   [ ] Ensure UI tests verify that tapping digit buttons correctly updates the `CalculatorView` display (e.g., "1" then "2" then "3" shows "123").
*   [ ] Consider edge cases like multiple leading zeros (e.g., "007" should display "7").
