### Story: Performing Basic Arithmetic

**Description:** As a user, I want to perform a calculation using two numbers and one operator.

**Prerequisites:** Story 4.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   The Interactor contains the logic to execute addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
*   When an operator button is tapped, the Presenter instructs the Interactor to set the pending operation.
*   When the "=" button is tapped, the Presenter instructs the Interactor to perform the calculation.
*   The Interactor calculates the result, updates its state, and passes the result back to the Presenter.
*   The Presenter formats and displays the final result in the View.
*   Example: `2 + 3 =` correctly displays `5`.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Cannot assess without code.

### Refactoring Performed
None, as code is not available for review.

### Compliance Check
*   Coding Standards: Cannot verify without code.
*   Project Structure: Cannot verify without code.
*   Testing Strategy: Extensive unit tests are critical for the Interactor's calculation logic. Integration tests for Presenter-Interactor communication and UI tests for end-to-end flow are also necessary.
*   All ACs Met: Cannot verify without code/tests.

### Improvements Checklist
*   [ ] Ensure comprehensive unit tests for the Interactor's addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division logic, covering positive, negative, zero, and decimal inputs.
*   [ ] Ensure unit tests verify the Presenter correctly sets pending operations and triggers calculations in the Interactor.
*   [ ] Ensure unit tests verify the Interactor correctly updates `CalculationState` and returns results.
*   [ ] Ensure unit tests verify the Presenter correctly formats and displays the final result.
*   [ ] Ensure UI tests cover various basic arithmetic operations (e.g., `2 + 3 = 5`, `10 - 4 = 6`, `5 * 6 = 30`, `9 / 3 = 3`).
*   [ ] Consider floating-point precision issues and how they are handled in the calculation logic.
