### Story: Division by Zero Error Handling

**Description:** As a user, if I attempt to divide a number by zero, I want to see a clear error message on the display.

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   If the user attempts to perform a division by zero, the Interactor detects the error.
*   The Interactor notifies the Presenter of a `CalculationError.divisionByZero`.
*   The Presenter formats an appropriate error message (e.g., "Error").
*   The `CalculatorView` displays the error message.

**Effort:** 2 Story Points

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Cannot assess without code.

### Refactoring Performed
None, as code is not available for review.

### Compliance Check
*   Coding Standards: Cannot verify without code.
*   Project Structure: Cannot verify without code.
*   Testing Strategy: Unit tests for Interactor's division logic and Presenter's error handling are critical. UI tests for displaying the error message are essential.
*   All ACs Met: Cannot verify without code/tests.

### Improvements Checklist
*   [ ] Ensure unit tests verify the Interactor correctly detects division by zero and throws `CalculationError.divisionByZero`.
*   [ ] Ensure unit tests verify the Presenter correctly handles `CalculationError.divisionByZero` and formats an appropriate error message.
*   [ ] Ensure UI tests verify that the `CalculatorView` displays the error message (e.g., "Error") when division by zero occurs.
*   [ ] Consider how the calculator behaves after an error message is displayed (e.g., does it require a "C" press to clear?).

### Security Review
Not directly applicable to this story.

### Performance Considerations
