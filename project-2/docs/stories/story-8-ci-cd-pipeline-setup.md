### Story: CI/CD Pipeline Setup

**Description:** As a developer, I want a CI/CD pipeline that automatically builds and tests the application on every push to `main` to ensure code quality and stability.

**Prerequisites:** None. Can be done in parallel.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   A GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) is created.
*   The workflow triggers on pushes and pull requests to the `main` branch.
*   The pipeline successfully checks out the code, selects the correct Xcode version, and runs the build command.
*   The pipeline runs all unit and UI tests.

**Effort:** 3 Story Points

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Cannot assess without the `ci.yml` file.

### Refactoring Performed
None, as code is not available for review.

### Compliance Check
*   Coding Standards: Cannot verify without the `ci.yml` file.
*   Project Structure: The `ci.yml` file should be in `.github/workflows/`.
*   Testing Strategy: This story is about enabling the testing strategy.
*   All ACs Met: Cannot verify without the `ci.yml` file and observing pipeline runs.

### Improvements Checklist
*   [ ] Verify the existence and content of `.github/workflows/ci.yml`.
*   [ ] Confirm the workflow triggers on pushes and pull requests to `main`.
*   [ ] Verify the pipeline successfully builds the project.
*   [ ] Verify the pipeline successfully runs all unit and UI tests.
*   [ ] Consider adding linting, code formatting checks, or other quality gates to the pipeline.
*   [ ] Ensure appropriate notifications are configured for pipeline failures.

### Security Review
Not directly applicable to this story, but the CI/CD environment itself should be secure.

### Performance Considerations
The pipeline run time should be optimized.

### Files Modified During Review
None.

### Recommended Status
✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above. The primary concern is the lack of concrete evidence (the `ci.yml` file and pipeline run logs) to review the setup.
