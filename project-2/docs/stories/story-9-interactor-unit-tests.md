### Story: Interactor Unit Tests

**Description:** As a developer, I need comprehensive unit tests for the `CalculatorInteractor` to verify the correctness of the business logic.

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Unit tests cover all arithmetic operations (+, -, Ã—, /).
*   Edge cases are tested, including division by zero and calculations with negative numbers.
*   Tests assert that the Interactor's output delegate is called with the correct `Decimal` value or `CalculationError`.
