### Story: Interactor Unit Tests

**Description:** As a developer, I need comprehensive unit tests for the `CalculatorInteractor` to verify the correctness of the business logic.

**Prerequisites:** Story 5.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
*   Unit tests cover all arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, /).
*   Edge cases are tested, including division by zero and calculations with negative numbers.
*   Tests assert that the Interactor's output delegate is called with the correct `Decimal` value or `CalculationError`.

**Effort:** 3 Story Points

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment
Cannot assess without the test code.

### Refactoring Performed
None, as code is not available for review.

### Compliance Check
*   Coding Standards: Cannot verify without the test code.
*   Project Structure: Unit tests should be placed in the `CalculatorTests` directory, likely `CalculatorInteractorTests.swift`.
*   Testing Strategy: This story is a direct implementation of the testing strategy for the `Interactor`.
*   All ACs Met: Cannot verify without the test code.

### Improvements Checklist
*   [ ] Verify the existence and content of `CalculatorInteractorTests.swift`.
*   [ ] Confirm unit tests cover all basic arithmetic operations (+, -, ×, /) with various inputs (positive, negative, zero, decimals).
*   [ ] Confirm unit tests specifically cover division by zero scenarios, asserting `CalculationError.divisionByZero`.
*   [ ] Confirm unit tests verify calculations with negative numbers.
*   [ ] Confirm tests assert that the `Interactor`'s output delegate is called with the correct results or errors.
*   [ ] Ensure test cases are clear, isolated, and follow a consistent naming convention.

### Security Review
Not directly applicable to this story.

### Performance Considerations
Unit tests should run quickly.
