# Error Handling Strategy

## General Approach

*   **Error Model:** We will use a system of custom Python exceptions. A base `AppException` will be created, and more specific exceptions (e.g., `UserNotFoundException`, `DuplicateUserException`) will inherit from it.
*   **Exception Hierarchy:** This allows us to catch specific error types and handle them appropriately.
*   **Error Propagation:** Exceptions raised in the business logic or data access layers will be caught by global FastAPI exception handlers. These handlers will be responsible for logging the error and returning a standardized, user-friendly JSON error response with the correct HTTP status code.

## Logging Standards

*   **Library:** Python's built-in `logging` module.
*   **Format:** **JSON**. Structured logs are machine-readable, making them easy to search, filter, and analyze in modern logging platforms (like AWS CloudWatch Logs or the ELK stack).
*   **Levels:** Standard Python log levels will be used (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).
*   **Required Context:**
    *   **Correlation ID:** A unique ID will be generated for each incoming request (or read from an `X-Request-ID` header) and included in every log message produced while handling that request. This allows us to trace a single user's action throughout the entire system.

## Error Handling Patterns

*   **External API Errors:**
    *   *(Not applicable for MVP)*. When external APIs are added, we will implement standard patterns like **Retry policies** for transient failures and **Circuit Breakers** for prolonged outages.
*   **Business Logic Errors:**
    *   **Custom Exceptions:** Specific exceptions like `UserNotFoundException` will be raised from the business logic to clearly signal the error condition.
    *   **User-Facing Errors:** The API exception handlers will convert these exceptions into clean JSON responses (e.g., `{"detail": "A user with this email already exists"}`) with an appropriate HTTP status code (e.g., 400 Bad Request).
*   **Data Consistency:**
    *   **Transaction Strategy:** We will leverage SQLAlchemy's session management. For any business logic that involves multiple database writes, all operations will be performed within a single transaction block (`try...except...finally` with a `session.commit()` or `session.rollback()`) to ensure data integrity.
