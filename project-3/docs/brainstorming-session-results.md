## Technique Sessions

### What If Scenarios - (Duration: ~5-10 min)
**Description:** Exploring hypothetical situations to uncover new ideas or challenges.
**Ideas Generated:**
1.  **Question:** What if we designed the system to be completely passwordless? How would user registration, login, and profile updates work then?
    -   **Idea:** Using one-time password from email.
2.  **Question:** If a malicious actor gains access to a user's email account, they could potentially receive the one-time password. In such a scenario, how would our FastAPI backend prevent unauthorized access to the user's profile and ensure their data remains secure, even with a correct OTP?
    -   **Idea:** Add 2FA later.
**Insights Discovered:**
- Passwordless systems introduce new security considerations, particularly around email account compromise.
- 2FA is a common solution for mitigating risks in passwordless or OTP-based systems.
**Notable Connections:**
- The need for robust security measures even with alternative authentication flows.

### Mind Mapping - (Duration: ~5-10 min)
**Description:** Visually organizing ideas around a central concept.
**Ideas Generated:**
- **Central Concept:** User Management for the FastAPI Backend
- **Branches:**
    1.  User Data
    2.  User Email and Password
    3.  JWT JSON Web Token
    4.  OAuth
**Insights Discovered:**
- Key components of user management include data storage, credentials, and authentication/authorization mechanisms.
- Modern authentication often involves tokens and external providers.
**Notable Connections:**
- "User Email and Password" is a subset of "User Data" and connects to "JWT" and "OAuth" for authentication.

### "Yes, And..." Building - (Duration: ~5-10 min)
**Description:** Collaboratively building on ideas by adding to previous statements.
**Ideas Generated:**
1.  **Agent:** Our FastAPI backend will have a `/register` endpoint that accepts a username, email, and password.
2.  **User:** Yes, and choose endpoint by yourself and followed with other's design.
3.  **Agent:** Yes, and we'll ensure that the chosen endpoint paths are clear, RESTful, and adhere to common API design best practices, making them intuitive for developers to consume.
4.  **User:** And I want to integrate frontend Nextjs later, so YOU HAVE TO DESIGN JWT authentication flow.
5.  **Agent:** Yes, and designing the JWT authentication flow will include defining how tokens are issued upon successful login, how they are securely stored and transmitted between the Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend, and how refresh tokens will be managed to ensure a seamless and secure user experience without frequent re-authentication.
**Insights Discovered:**
- Importance of clear, RESTful API design.
- The need to consider frontend integration (Next.js) early in the backend design, especially for authentication flows.
- JWT authentication requires careful consideration of token issuance, storage, transmission, and refresh mechanisms.
**Notable Connections:**
- Direct link between backend API design and frontend consumption.
- JWT authentication is a critical component for secure API access.

### Five Whys - (Duration: ~5-10 min)
**Description:** Repeatedly asking "Why?" to explore the cause-and-effect relationships underlying a particular problem.
**Ideas Generated:**
- **Problem:** Users are sometimes unable to log in to the system.
    -   **Why 1:** Wrong password or email, email format error.
    -   **Why 2:** Forgot password.
    -   **Why 3:** Too long or too complicated.
    -   **Why 4:** Security.
    -   **Why 5:** In case of hacking.
**Insights Discovered:**
- The root cause of login issues due to forgotten passwords often stems from the perceived need for complex passwords for security against hacking.
- This highlights a tension between security requirements and user usability/memorability.
**Notable Connections:**
- Connects to the "What If Scenarios" discussion on passwordless systems and 2FA as alternative security measures.

### Role Playing - (Duration: ~5-10 min)
**Description:** Brainstorming from different stakeholder perspectives.
**Ideas Generated:**
- **Role:** New user trying to register for the first time.
    -   **Concerns/Desires (Registration/Login):** Google login and/or Facebook login.
    -   **Concerns/Desires (Information):** Name, birthday (potentially intrusive).
    -   **Expectations/Desires (Post-login):** Delete account.
    -   **Why Delete Account:** Let user know we do not save their profile when they deleted (transparency, data privacy).
**Insights Discovered:**
- New users prioritize convenience (social logins) and control over their personal data (minimal information, easy account deletion).
- Transparency about data handling, especially deletion, builds trust.
**Notable Connections:**
- Social logins connect to the "Mind Mapping" idea of OAuth.
- Account deletion connects to broader data privacy and user trust.

### Time Shifting - (Duration: ~5-10 min)
**Description:** Considering how a problem would be solved in different time periods.
**Ideas Generated:**
- **Problem:** User authentication and profile management.
    -   **1995 Solution:** Email login, password length must be larger than 8.
    -   **2030 Solution:** Social login, or Metamask / wallet login.
**Insights Discovered:**
- Authentication methods evolve significantly over time, driven by technological advancements and changing user expectations.
- Future authentication may lean towards decentralized or identity-provider-based solutions.
**Notable Connections:**
- Reinforces the ideas of social login and passwordless systems from other techniques.
