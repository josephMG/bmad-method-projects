# Project Improvement Plan

This document outlines key areas for improvement identified during our discussions, along with proposed next steps and responsible agents.

## 1. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

*   **Description:** Implement E2E tests to cover real API requests/responses and user interactions, ensuring the entire application flow works as expected from a user's perspective.
*   **Primary Agents:** Quinn (Test Architect), James (Dev)
*   **Next Steps:** Create a dedicated story to define the E2E testing framework, select tools (e.g., Playwright), identify critical user journeys, and set up initial tests.

## 2. Observability

*   **Description:** Integrate robust monitoring and alerting for performance metrics, application health, and security events across both backend and frontend.
*   **Primary Agents:** Winston (Architect), James (Dev)
*   **Next Steps:** Create a story to research and implement a comprehensive observability stack (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, ELK stack, cloud-native solutions) and define key metrics and alerts.

## 3. API Gateway/Service Mesh Integration

*   **Description:** Explore the integration of an API Gateway or Service Mesh for centralized traffic management, security policies, and enhanced observability for microservices.
*   **Primary Agents:** Winston (Architect)
*   **Next Steps:** Conduct a research task to evaluate suitable API Gateway/Service Mesh solutions and their benefits/drawbacks for our architecture.

## 4. Security Penetration Testing

*   **Description:** Formalize security penetration testing beyond static analysis to identify vulnerabilities through simulated attacks.
*   **Primary Agents:** Quinn (Test Architect)
*   **Next Steps:** Create a task to define a strategy for regular penetration testing, including scope, tools, and reporting mechanisms.

## 5. Usability Testing

*   **Description:** Conduct usability testing with real users to gather early feedback on the intuitiveness, efficiency, and overall user satisfaction of the UI/UX.
*   **Primary Agents:** Sally (UX Expert), Mary (Analyst)
*   **Next Steps:** Create a task to plan and execute initial usability testing sessions for core user flows (registration, login, profile management).

## 6. Detailed Design System

*   **Description:** Develop a more detailed design system beyond Material-UI guidelines to ensure greater consistency, reusability, and efficiency for future UI development.
*   **Primary Agents:** Sally (UX Expert)
*   **Next Steps:** Create a task to define the scope and initial components of a project-specific design system.

## 7. Formal Competitive Analysis

*   **Description:** Conduct a formal competitive analysis of other user management systems to identify unique selling points, market gaps, and potential feature inspirations.
*   **Primary Agents:** Mary (Analyst), John (PM)
*   **Next Steps:** Create a task to perform a detailed competitive analysis, including feature comparison, security models, and scalability.

## 8. Roadmap Definition

*   **Description:** Define clear Phase 2 and long-term vision roadmaps with estimated timelines, resource allocation, and strategic goals for future development.
*   **Primary Agents:** John (PM)
*   **Next Steps:** Create a task to facilitate a roadmap planning session with key stakeholders.

## 9. Dependency Management & Updates

*   **Description:** Establish a clear process for evaluating, integrating, and managing major version upgrades of core libraries and dependencies to prevent technical debt.
*   **Primary Agents:** James (Dev), Winston (Architect)
*   **Next Steps:** Create a task to define a dependency management policy and process, including tools and responsibilities.

## 10. Frontend Error Logging & Monitoring

*   **Description:** Implement a more detailed error logging and monitoring setup for the frontend to quickly identify and resolve user-facing issues.
*   **Primary Agents:** James (Dev), Sally (UX Expert)
*   **Next Steps:** Create a story to research and integrate a frontend error monitoring solution (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) and define logging standards.

## 11. Workflow Definitions Review

*   **Description:** Regularly review and update our workflow definitions in `.bmad-core/workflows/` based on lessons learned from completed epics and evolving project needs.
*   **Primary Agents:** Bob (SM), BMad Orchestrator
*   **Next Steps:** Schedule a recurring task for workflow review and refinement sessions.
