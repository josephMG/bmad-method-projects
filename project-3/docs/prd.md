# User Management Backend Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Goals and Background Context

#### Goals
*   Establish a foundational, reusable user authentication and profile management service.
*   Enhance overall application security posture.
*   Reduce development time for new applications requiring user management.
*   Support future growth and scalability of user base.

#### Background Context
This project focuses on developing a robust Python FastAPI backend for user authentication and profile management. It aims to solve the critical need for secure and efficient user identity handling in modern applications. The primary target market includes developers and businesses building applications that require a scalable and secure user management system, particularly those integrating with Next.js frontends. Our key value proposition is to deliver a modern, containerized solution that provides a secure foundation for user management, supporting advanced authentication features like JWT and 2FA, while being easily deployable with Docker and PostgreSQL.

Many modern applications face significant challenges in implementing secure, user-friendly, and scalable user authentication and profile management systems. Common pain points include security vulnerabilities, poor user experience, development complexity & maintenance overhead, and lack of user control & transparency. The impact of these problems can be severe, ranging from reputational damage due to security incidents to reduced user engagement and increased development costs. This solution will succeed where others haven't by striking a superior balance between cutting-edge security, developer efficiency, and an intuitive user experience.

## Requirements

#### Functional
1.  **FR1:** The system shall allow new users to register with a unique email/username and password, including basic validation and secure password hashing.
2.  **FR2:** The system shall enable registered users to log in using their credentials, issuing a JWT upon successful authentication for subsequent requests.
3.  **FR3:** Authenticated users shall be able to change their password after providing their current password for validation.
4.  **FR4:** Authenticated users shall be able to update their basic profile information (e.g., name, email).
5.  **FR5:** Authenticated users shall be able to initiate a process to permanently delete their account and associated data, with clear confirmation and transparency.

#### Non Functional
1.  **NFR1:** The authentication module shall achieve a security audit score of 90% or higher.
2.  **NFR2:** New application integration time for user management shall be reduced by 25% compared to previous manual implementations.
3.  **NFR3:** The system shall be capable of handling 1,000 concurrent users for the MVP, with scalability to support 100,000+ in the long term.
4.  **NFR4:** Authentication endpoints (login, registration) shall respond within 200ms under normal load, with a target of <100ms.
5.  **NFR5:** The system shall maintain a login success rate of 99% or higher, with a target of >99.5%.
6.  **NFR6:** The system shall provide high availability (e.g., 99.9% uptime) for core authentication services.
7.  **NFR7:** Sensitive data (e.g., passwords) shall be stored using strong, one-way hashing algorithms (bcrypt), and data in transit shall be secured via HTTPS/TLS.
8.  **NFR8:** The system shall implement robust access control mechanisms to ensure only authorized users and services can access specific resources.
9.  **NFR9:** Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning shall be part of the development lifecycle.
10. **NFR10:** The system shall adhere to relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
11. **NFR11:** The system shall aim for a user registration completion rate of 90% or higher.
12. **NFR12:** The average time for the password reset process shall be under 2 minutes (post-MVP).
13. **NFR13:** User satisfaction for authentication and profile management features shall be 4 out of 5 or higher.
14. **NFR14:** Account deletion requests shall be processed within 24 hours, with user confirmation of data removal.

## User Interface Design Goals

#### Overall UX Vision
The overall UX vision is to provide a secure, intuitive, and seamless user authentication and profile management experience.

#### Key Interaction Paradigms
Key interaction paradigms will follow standard web and mobile patterns for forms, notifications, and account management. The focus will be on clarity, ease of use, and minimizing friction for the end-user.

#### Core Screens and Views
*   Registration Screen
*   Login Screen
*   Change Password Screen
*   Profile Management Screen
*   Account Deletion Confirmation Screen

#### Accessibility: WCAG AA
#### Branding: To be defined by consuming application.
#### Target Device and Platforms: Web Responsive, Cross-Platform (for mobile)

## Technical Assumptions

#### Repository Structure: Polyrepo
*   **Rationale:** The brief states "Initial focus will be on a clear, modular structure for the FastAPI backend" and "the user management backend as a distinct service" within a "microservice-oriented architecture." This aligns well with a polyrepo approach where each distinct service resides in its own repository for greater independence. However, the brief also notes that "a monorepo approach could be considered for related services," which suggests flexibility for future expansion.
*   **Assumption:** For the user management backend itself, a polyrepo structure is assumed to promote independent development and deployment.

#### Service Architecture: Microservices
*   **Rationale:** The brief explicitly states, "The system will follow a microservice-oriented architecture, with the user management backend as a distinct service." This decision is foundational to the overall system design.
*   **Assumption:** The user management backend will operate as an independent microservice, communicating with other services via RESTful APIs.

#### Testing Requirements: Unit + Integration
*   **Rationale:** While not explicitly detailed in the brief, a robust backend service typically requires both unit and integration tests to ensure individual components function correctly and that they interact as expected. This provides a good balance of test coverage and development efficiency for an MVP.
*   **Assumption:** The development process will include comprehensive unit tests for individual functions and components, as well as integration tests to verify the interactions between different parts of the service (e.g., database interactions, API endpoints).

#### Additional Technical Assumptions and Requests
*   **Backend Framework:** FastAPI (Python)
*   **Web Server:** Uvicorn
*   **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
*   **Database Migration Tool:** Alembic
*   **Security Libraries:** Passlib (bcrypt for password hashing), python-jose (for JWT handling)
*   **Configuration Management:** pydantic-settings / dotenv
*   **Python Package Management:** uv
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL
*   **Hosting/Infrastructure:** Docker and docker-compose for local development and deployment orchestration. Cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure) for production deployment.
*   **Data Encryption:** Sensitive data will be stored using strong, one-way hashing algorithms (bcrypt), and data in transit will be secured via HTTPS/TLS.
*   **Access Control:** Robust access control mechanisms will be implemented.
*   **Vulnerability Management:** Regular security audits and vulnerability scanning shall be part of the development lifecycle.
*   **Compliance:** Adherence to relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) will be a key consideration.
