# Epic: Next.js Frontend Integration with User Management Service

## 1. Introduction

This epic outlines the development and integration of a new Next.js frontend application. This frontend will serve as the primary user interface for interacting with the existing `@user-management-service` backend, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly experience for managing user accounts. The frontend will be built using modern web technologies and will adhere to the existing project's Docker-based deployment strategy.

## 2. Goals

*   To provide a modern, responsive, and intuitive user interface for the `@user-management-service`.
*   To enable users to perform all core user management actions (registration, login, profile management, password changes, account deletion) through the frontend.
*   To ensure a seamless and efficient integration with the existing backend APIs.
*   To maintain consistency with the project's existing DevOps practices by containerizing the frontend with Docker and Docker-compose.
*   To deliver a visually appealing and UI/UX friendly application.

## 3. Scope

### In Scope:
*   Development of a Next.js application.
*   Integration of RTK Query for API interaction.
*   Implementation of Redux Toolkit for state management.
*   Use of Axios for HTTP requests.
*   Styling and UI components using Material-UI.
*   Frontend features for:
    *   User Registration
    *   User Login (fetching JWT)
    *   User Profile Management (get and update user details)
    *   Change Password
    *   Delete User Account
*   Dockerization of the Next.js application.
*   Integration of the frontend into the existing `docker-compose.yml` for unified deployment with the `@user-management-service` backend.

### Out of Scope:
*   Any modifications to the existing `@user-management-service` backend API logic.
*   Advanced features such as multi-factor authentication, social logins, or complex user roles beyond what the current backend supports.
*   Internationalization (i18n) or localization.
*   Extensive analytics or tracking.

*   [User Registration Frontend](stories/2.2.user-registration-frontend.story.md)
*   [User Login Frontend](stories/2.3.user-login-frontend.story.md)
*   [User Profile Management Frontend](stories/2.4.user-profile-management-frontend.story.md)
*   [Change Password Frontend](stories/2.5.change-password-frontend.story.md)
*   [Delete User Account Frontend](stories/2.6.delete-user-account-frontend.story.md)

## 5. Technical Considerations

*   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js
*   **State Management:** Redux Toolkit with RTK Query
*   **HTTP Client:** Axios
*   **UI Library:** Material-UI
*   **Containerization:** Docker
*   **Orchestration:** Docker-compose
*   **API Endpoints:** All user management APIs provided by `@user-management-service`.
*   **Environment Variables:** Secure handling of API endpoints and other sensitive configurations.

## 6. Dependencies

*   Existing `@user-management-service` backend APIs must be stable and well-documented.
*   Docker and Docker-compose environment for local development and deployment.

## 7. Success Metrics

*   Successful deployment of the Next.js frontend via Docker-compose.
*   All specified user management functionalities (register, login, update, get, change password, delete) are fully operational and integrated with the backend.
*   Positive feedback on UI/UX and overall aesthetic appeal.
*   Minimal to no errors reported during user interaction with the frontend.

## 8. Open Questions / Risks

*   **Risk:** Potential breaking changes in backend APIs during frontend development.
*   **Risk:** Performance bottlenecks with Material-UI or Redux Toolkit if not optimized correctly.
*   **Open Question:** Specific design guidelines or mockups for the "very pretty" UI/UX.
*   **Open Question:** Error handling and user feedback mechanisms for API interactions.
