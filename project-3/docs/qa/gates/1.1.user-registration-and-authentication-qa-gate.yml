  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - 'Ensure Passlib[bcrypt] is configured with appropriate work factors and salting.'
      - 'Use strong, randomly generated secret keys for JWT signing and implement proper expiration/renewal.'
      - 'Implement comprehensive input validation using Pydantic schemas and sanitize all user-provided inputs.'
      - 'Implement a centralized logging policy that explicitly forbids logging of sensitive data.'
    monitor:
      - 'Monitor database query performance for user lookups and consider caching if needed.'
      - 'Ensure unique constraints are enforced at both database and application levels for email/username.'
