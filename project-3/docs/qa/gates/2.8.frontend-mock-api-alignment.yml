story_title: Frontend Mock API Alignment for User Management
decision: PASS
date: 2025-10-02
reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)
findings: All frontend unit and integration tests related to user management API alignment passed successfully. The `LoginForm` component was updated to correctly send `username` instead of `email` to the backend, resolving the `username=undefined` issue. Mock API definitions accurately reflect backend API contracts.
conclusion: The frontend mock API alignment for user management is confirmed and meets the acceptance criteria.
