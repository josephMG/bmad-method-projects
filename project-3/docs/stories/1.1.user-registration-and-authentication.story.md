# Story 1.1: User Registration and Authentication

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** new or existing user,
**I want** to register for an account with a unique email/username and password, and then log in to access the system,
**so that** I can securely access and manage my profile.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The system shall allow new users to register with a unique email/username and password, including basic validation and secure password hashing.
2. The system shall enable registered users to log in using their credentials, issuing a JWT upon successful authentication for subsequent requests.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Implement user registration endpoint (`POST /register`)
  - [x] Validate user input (email, username, password) using Pydantic schemas.
  - [x] Check for existing user with the provided email or username.
  - [x] Hash the user's password using `Passlib[bcrypt]`.
  - [x] Create a new user record in the PostgreSQL database via the CRUD layer.
  - [x] Return the newly created user data (excluding hashed password).
  - [x] Add unit tests for the registration service logic.
  - [x] Add integration tests for the `/register` endpoint.
- [x] Implement user login endpoint (`POST /token`)
  - [x] Validate user input (username, password) using FastAPI's `OAuth2PasswordRequestForm`.
  - [x] Retrieve user from the database by email or username via the CRUD layer.
  - [x] Verify the provided password against the stored hashed password using `Passlib[bcrypt]`.
  - [x] If authentication is successful, create a JWT using `python-jose`.
  - [x] Return the JWT access token and token type.
  - [x] Add unit tests for the authentication service logic.
  - [x] Add integration tests for the `/token` endpoint.
- [x] Define Pydantic schemas for `UserCreate`, `UserRead`, and `Token`.
- [x] Define SQLAlchemy ORM model for `User`.
- [x] Implement CRUD operations for user creation and retrieval (`crud_user.py`).
- [x] Configure FastAPI application to include authentication routes.
- [x] Ensure all sensitive data (passwords, JWTs) are handled securely and not logged.

### Testing

- **Approach:** Test-After Development. Tests will be written immediately after a feature is implemented. All code must be accompanied by tests in the same pull request. [Source: architecture.md#Testing Philosophy]
- **Coverage Goals:** >90% code coverage on critical business logic (`services`) and data access (`crud`) layers, with an overall project coverage target of >85%. [Source: architecture.md#Testing Philosophy]
- **Unit Tests:**
  - **Framework:** Pytest
  - **Location & Convention:** `tests/unit/test_*.py`
  - **Mocking Library:** Python's built-in `unittest.mock`.
  - **AI Agent Requirements:** Generate tests for all public methods and functions. Mock all external dependencies (e.g., mock the data access layer when testing the service layer). Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
    [Source: architecture.md#Unit Tests]
- **Integration Tests:**
  - **Scope:** To test the service from the API boundary down to a real database, ensuring all layers work together correctly.
  - **Location:** `tests/integration/`
  - **Test Infrastructure:** Testcontainers to programmatically spin up a real PostgreSQL Docker container for the test suite.
    [Source: architecture.md#Integration Tests]
- **Test Data Management:** Factory pattern (with `factory-boy`) for consistent, reusable test data. Pytest fixtures in `conftest.py` for reusable test setup. Each test will run inside an isolated database transaction that is automatically rolled back. [Source: architecture.md#Test Data Management]
- **Security Tests:** `Bandit` static analysis security tool integrated into CI pipeline. [Source: architecture.md#Continuous Testing]

### Technical Constraints

- **Python Version:** Python 3.11 [Source: architecture.md#Core Standards]
- **Password Hashing:** `Passlib[bcrypt]` [Source: architecture.md#Security]
- **JWT Handling:** `python-jose` [Source: architecture.md#Security]
- **Configuration Management:** `pydantic-settings` [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **Database:** PostgreSQL [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **Input Validation:** Pydantic at the API Boundary. [Source: architecture.md#Input Validation]
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Stateless system. [Source: architecture.md#Authentication & Authorization]
- **Secrets Management:** `.env` for development, environment variables for production. Never hardcode secrets. [Source: architecture.md#Secrets Management]
- **Logging Restrictions:** No plaintext passwords, API keys, or JWTs in logs. [Source: architecture.md#Data Protection]

### Review Date: 2025-09-25

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The draft definition of Story 1.1 is exceptionally high quality. It provides comprehensive details on requirements, data models, API specifications, component breakdown, file locations, and testing strategy. The references to the architecture document are precise and highly effective. This story is well-prepared for development.

### Refactoring Performed

None. This is a review of a draft story definition.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (Adheres to referenced architecture.md guidelines for Python 3.11, Ruff, PEP 8)
- Project Structure: ✓ (References architecture.md for file locations)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (Comprehensive testing approach outlined, referencing architecture.md)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (Acceptance Criteria are clear, concise, and testable)

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] No significant improvements needed for the draft definition.

### Security Review

The story definition explicitly references and adheres to the security guidelines outlined in `architecture.md`, covering password hashing, JWT handling, secrets management, input validation, and logging restrictions. The definition itself demonstrates a strong focus on security.

### Performance Considerations

The story definition does not explicitly detail performance requirements for registration/login. While the chosen tech stack (FastAPI, PostgreSQL) is performant, specific NFRs for response times or throughput are not defined within the story. This is a minor observation for a draft definition and would typically be covered at a higher level (e.g., PRD or NFR assessment).

### Files Modified During Review

None. This review is of the story definition.

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/1.1.user-registration-and-authentication.yml
Risk profile: N/A (Not performed for draft definition)
NFR assessment: N/A (Not performed for draft definition)
