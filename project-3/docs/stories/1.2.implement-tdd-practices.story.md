# Story 1.2: Implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) Practices

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** development team,
**We want** to implement Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices,
**so that** we can improve code quality, reduce defects, and ensure a robust and maintainable codebase.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The development workflow shall incorporate writing failing tests before writing production code for new features and bug fixes.
2. All new code developed shall adhere to the TDD cycle (Red-Green-Refactor).
3. Unit tests shall be comprehensive, covering all public methods and functions, and mock external dependencies.
4. Integration tests shall verify the interaction between components and the database using Testcontainers.
5. The CI/CD pipeline shall enforce TDD practices by requiring tests to pass before code can be merged.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Define and document the TDD workflow for the team.
- [x] Update `docs/architecture.md` to reflect the shift from "Test-After Development" to "Test-Driven Development" as the primary testing philosophy for new development.
- [x] Create a new `tests/unit/example_tdd_flow.py` demonstrating the Red-Green-Refactor cycle for a simple function.
- [x] Refactor existing tests (if any, from story 1.1) to align with TDD principles where applicable, or at least ensure they meet the quality standards for unit and integration tests.
- [x] Implement a mechanism in the CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) to check for test coverage and enforce passing tests.
- [x] Provide guidance on mocking strategies for external dependencies in unit tests.
- [x] Ensure `factory-boy` and Pytest fixtures are used effectively for test data management.

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established initial testing frameworks (Pytest, `unittest.mock`, Testcontainers). This story builds upon that foundation by formalizing the *process* of writing tests.

### Data Models
No specific data models are directly impacted by implementing TDD practices, but TDD will apply to the development of features involving data models.

### API Specifications
TDD will be applied to the development of new API endpoints and modifications to existing ones.

### Component Specifications
TDD will be applied to the development of all components (API Layer, Business Logic Layer, Data Access Layer, Security Component, Configuration Component).

### File Locations
- `tests/unit/`: For unit tests. [Source: architecture.md#Unit Tests]
- `tests/integration/`: For integration tests. [Source: architecture.md#Integration Tests]
- `conftest.py`: For Pytest fixtures. [Source: architecture.md#Test Data Management]
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`: For CI/CD pipeline updates. [Source: architecture.md#CI/CD Platform]

### Testing
- **Frameworks:** Pytest, `unittest.mock`, Testcontainers, `factory-boy`. [Source: architecture.md#Test Strategy and Standards]
- **Coverage Goals:** >90% on `services` and `crud` layers, overall >85%. [Source: architecture.md#Testing Philosophy]
- **Pattern:** Arrange-Act-Assert for unit tests. [Source: architecture.md#Unit Tests]
- **Security Tests:** Bandit static analysis in CI. [Source: architecture.md#Continuous Testing]
- **Test Data:** Factory pattern, Pytest fixtures, isolated transactions. [Source: architecture.md#Test Data Management]

- **Peer Review Guideline:** During code reviews, reviewers should specifically check for adherence to the Red-Green-Refactor cycle, ensuring that tests are written before production code and that refactoring is performed.
- **CRITICAL NOTE:** TDD principles (Red-Green-Refactor) are expected to be applied to both unit and integration tests.

### Technical Constraints
- **Python Version:** Python 3.11. [Source: architecture.md#Core Standards]
- **Linting/Formatting:** Ruff. [Source: architecture.md#Core Standards]
- **Critical Rules for AI Agents:** Service Layer, CRUD Layer, DI, No Secrets, Specific Exceptions must be followed during TDD. [Source: architecture.md#Critical Rules for AI Agents]

## Project Structure Notes
The existing project structure already includes a `tests/` directory, which aligns with the requirements. The task will involve creating new files within this structure.

### Review Date: 2025-09-25

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The draft definition of Story 1.2 is now excellent. The additions of a critical note emphasizing TDD for integration tests and a peer review guideline for the Red-Green-Refactor cycle have effectively addressed previous concerns. This story provides clear and comprehensive guidance for implementing TDD practices.

### Refactoring Performed

No code refactoring was performed as this story defines practices, not code implementation.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (The story aligns with the architectural coding standards by promoting TDD and referencing existing tools like Ruff.)
- Project Structure: ✓ (The planned test file locations align with the defined project structure.)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (The story directly addresses and aims to enhance the project's testing strategy by shifting to TDD from Test-After Development, with clear enforcement mechanisms.)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (The ACs are well-defined and the story now provides clear guidance for their validation.)

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] No further improvements needed for the draft definition.

### Security Review

The implementation of TDD practices will indirectly enhance security by promoting more robust and defect-free code. The CI/CD pipeline's enforcement of passing tests, which includes Bandit static analysis, will further contribute to security. No specific security concerns were identified in the story itself.

### Performance Considerations

This story does not directly address performance, but TDD generally leads to more efficient and optimized code due to continuous refactoring. No performance issues were identified.
