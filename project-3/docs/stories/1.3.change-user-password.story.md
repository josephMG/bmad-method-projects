# Story 1.3: Change User Password

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** registered user,
**I want** to change my password,
**so that** I can maintain the security of my account.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Authenticated users shall be able to change their password after providing their current password for validation.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement password change endpoint (`PUT /users/me/password`)
  - [x] Validate user input (current_password, new_password) using Pydantic schemas.
  - [x] Retrieve the authenticated user's record.
  - [x] Verify the provided `current_password` against the stored hashed password using `Passlib[bcrypt]`.
  - [x] If valid, hash the `new_password` using `Passlib[bcrypt]`.
  - [x] Update the user's `hashed_password` in the database via the CRUD layer.
  - [x] Add unit tests for the password change service logic.
  - [x] Add integration tests for the `/users/me/password` endpoint.
- [x] Define Pydantic schema for `PasswordUpdate`.
- [x] Update `crud_user.py` to include a method for updating a user's password.
- [x] Update `user_service.py` to include business logic for changing a user's password.
- [ ] Ensure all sensitive data (passwords) are handled securely and not logged.
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for the password change endpoint to prevent brute-force attacks.

## Dev Notes
### Previous Story Insights
Story 1.1 established the foundational user registration and authentication, including password hashing and JWT generation. This story builds upon that by allowing authenticated users to modify their password, leveraging existing security components.

### Data Models
- **User Model Attributes (relevant for this story):**
  - `id`: `UUID` (Primary Key)
  - `hashed_password`: `String` (Not Null) - This field will be updated.
  - `updated_at`: `DateTime` (Not Null, Default `NOW()`) - This field will be automatically updated upon password change.

### API Specifications
- **Change current user password:**
  - `PUT /users/me/password`
  - **Security:** Requires `bearerAuth` (JWT).
  - **Request Body:** `application/json` with `PasswordUpdate` schema (`current_password`, `new_password`).
  - **Responses:**
    - `204 No Content`: Password updated successfully.

### Component Specifications
- **API Layer (Routes):** Defines RESTful API endpoints, handles requests, validates data, serializes responses. Technology: FastAPI. [Source: architecture.md#API Layer (Routes)]
- **Business Logic Layer (Services):** Contains core application logic, enforces business rules (e.g., verifying current password). Technology: Plain Python. [Source: architecture.md#Business Logic Layer (Services)]
- **Data Access Layer (Repositories):** Abstracts database interactions (updating user record). Technology: SQLAlchemy. [Source: architecture.md#Data Access Layer (Repositories)]
- **Security Component:** Centralizes security operations (password hashing and verification). Technology: Passlib. [Source: architecture.md#Security Component]
- **Configuration Component:** Manages application settings. Technology: pydantic-settings. [Source: architecture.md#Configuration Component]

### Testing
- **Approach:** Test-After Development. Tests will be written immediately after a feature is implemented. All code must be accompanied by tests in the same pull request. [Source: architecture.md#Testing Philosophy]
- **Coverage Goals:** >90% code coverage on critical business logic (`services`) and data access (`crud`) layers, with an overall project coverage target of >85%. [Source: architecture.md#Testing Philosophy]
- **Unit Tests:**
  - **Framework:** Pytest
  - **Location & Convention:** `tests/unit/test_*.py`
  - **Mocking Library:** Python's built-in `unittest.mock`.
  - **AI Agent Requirements:** Generate tests for all public methods and functions. Mock all external dependencies (e.g., mock the data access layer when testing the service layer). Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
  [Source: architecture.md#Unit Tests]
- **Integration Tests:**
  - **Scope:** To test the service from the API boundary down to a real database, ensuring all layers work together correctly.
  - **Location:** `tests/integration/`
  - **Test Infrastructure:** Testcontainers to programmatically spin up a real PostgreSQL Docker container for the test suite.
  [Source: architecture.md#Integration Tests]
- **Test Data Management:** Factory pattern (with `factory-boy`) for consistent, reusable test data. Pytest fixtures in `conftest.py` for reusable test setup. Each test will run inside an isolated database transaction that is automatically rolled back. [Source: architecture.md#Test Data Management]
- **Security Tests:** `Bandit` static analysis security tool integrated into CI pipeline. [Source: architecture.md#Continuous Testing]

### Technical Constraints
- **Python Version:** Python 3.11 [Source: architecture.md#Core Standards]
- **Password Hashing:** `Passlib[bcrypt]` for hashing and verification. [Source: architecture.md#Security]
- **JWT Handling:** `python-jose` for authentication (to secure the endpoint). [Source: architecture.md#Security]
- **Configuration Management:** `pydantic-settings` [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **Database:** PostgreSQL [Source: architecture.md#Tech Stack]
- **Input Validation:** Pydantic at the API Boundary. [Source: architecture.md#Input Validation]
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) via `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. Stateless system. [Source: architecture.md#Authentication & Authorization]
- **Secrets Management:** `.env` for development, environment variables for production. Never hardcode secrets. [Source: architecture.md#Secrets Management]
- **Logging Restrictions:** No plaintext passwords, API keys, or JWTs in logs. [Source: architecture.md#Data Protection]

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The draft definition of Story 1.3 is now excellent. The addition of the task for implementing rate limiting for password change attempts has effectively addressed the previous security concern. This story provides clear and comprehensive guidance for implementing secure password change functionality.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring was performed at this stage, as this is a review of the story definition.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (Assumed to be followed during implementation)
