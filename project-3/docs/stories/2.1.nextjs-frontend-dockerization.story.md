# Story 2.1: Next.js Frontend Dockerization and Docker-compose Integration

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to containerize the Next.js frontend application using Docker and integrate it into the existing `docker-compose.yml`,
**so that** the frontend can be deployed consistently with the user management service backend.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. The Next.js application is successfully Dockerized.
2. A `Dockerfile` is created for the Next.js application.
3. The Next.js application is integrated into the existing `docker-compose.yml` file.
4. The frontend and backend services can be brought up and run together using `docker-compose up`.
5. The Dockerized frontend is accessible via a defined port.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Create a new `nextjs-frontend` directory for the Next.js application.
- [x] Initialize a new Next.js project within the `nextjs-frontend` directory.
- [x] Create a `Dockerfile` for the Next.js application to containerize it.
  - [x] Define base image (Node.js 20.x LTS).
  - [x] Copy application files.
  - [x] Install dependencies.
  - [x] Build the Next.js application for production.
  - [x] Expose the necessary port (e.g., 3000).
  - [x] Define the startup command.
- [x] Integrate the Next.js service into the existing `docker-compose.yml` file.
  - [x] Add a new service entry for the `nextjs-frontend`.
  - [x] Specify the build context and `Dockerfile` path.
  - [x] Map ports for external access.
  - [x] Define environment variables for API endpoints and other configurations.
  - [x] Ensure the frontend service depends on the `user-management-service` backend.
- [x] Verify that both the frontend and backend services can be brought up and run together using `docker-compose up`. (AC: 4)
- [x] Confirm that the Dockerized frontend is accessible via the defined port. (AC: 5)
- [x] Add unit tests for the Dockerfile and docker-compose integration (e.g., linting Dockerfile, verifying service startup). (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories in this epic.

### Data Models
No specific data models are directly involved in the dockerization process. The frontend will interact with the `User Model` from the backend. [Source: architecture/data-models.md#User Model]

### API Specifications
The frontend will interact with all user management APIs provided by `@user-management-service`. Specific endpoints will be defined in subsequent stories. [Source: docs/prd/epic-5-nextjs-frontend-integration.md#5. Technical Considerations]

### Component Specifications
*   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js [Source: docs/prd/epic-5-nextjs-frontend-integration.md#5. Technical Considerations]
*   **Containerization:** Docker [Source: docs/prd/epic-5-nextjs-frontend-integration.md#5. Technical Considerations]
*   **Orchestration:** Docker-compose [Source: docs/prd/epic-5-nextjs-frontend-integration.md#5. Technical Considerations]

### File Locations
*   New `Dockerfile` for the Next.js application will be created in the root of the Next.js project (e.g., `nextjs-frontend/Dockerfile`).
*   The existing `docker-compose.yml` will be modified to include the Next.js service. [Source: docs/prd/epic-5-nextjs-frontend-integration.md#3. Scope]
*   The Next.js application will reside in a new directory, likely `nextjs-frontend/`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md - by inference, as new service]

### Testing
*   **Approach:** Test-After Development. Tests will be written immediately after a feature is implemented. All code must be accompanied by tests in the same pull request. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Testing Philosophy]
*   **Coverage Goals:** >90% code coverage on critical business logic and data access layers, with an overall project coverage target of >85%. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Testing Philosophy]
*   **Unit Tests:** Pytest, `tests/unit/test_*.py`, `unittest.mock`, Arrange-Act-Assert pattern. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Unit Tests]
*   **Integration Tests:** Testcontainers for PostgreSQL, `tests/integration/`. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Integration Tests]
*   **E2E Tests:** (Post-MVP) Pytest with Playwright. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#End-to-End (E2E) Tests]
*   **Test Data Management:** Factory pattern (`factory-boy`), Pytest fixtures in `conftest.py`, isolated database transactions. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Test Data Management]
*   **CI Integration:** GitHub Actions CI pipeline will run unit and integration tests on every pull request. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md#Continuous Testing]

### Technical Constraints
*   **Runtime:** Node.js 20.x LTS [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]
*   **Containerization:** Docker & Docker Compose latest [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md#Technology Stack Table]
*   **Environment Variables:** Secure handling of API endpoints and other sensitive configurations. [Source: docs/prd/epic-5-nextjs-frontend-integration.md#5. Technical Considerations]

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-27

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation is of high quality. The use of separate Dockerfiles for development, production, and testing is a good practice. The test setup with Vitest is also well done.

### Refactoring Performed

None.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: [✓]
- Project Structure: [✓]
- Testing Strategy: [✓]
- All ACs Met: [✓]

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] All items addressed.

### Security Review

No security concerns found.

### Performance Considerations

The use of a multi-stage build for the production Dockerfile is good for performance.

### Files Modified During Review
