# User Story: User Registration Frontend

## 1. Title

As a new user, I want to register for an account through the Next.js frontend, so that I can gain access to the user management features.

## 2. Description

This story focuses on implementing the user registration functionality within the Next.js frontend. It will involve creating a registration form, handling user input, and making an API call to the `@user-management-service` backend's registration endpoint. The frontend will provide clear feedback to the user during the registration process, including validation errors and success messages. The UI will be built using Material-UI components.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:

*   **Registration Form Display:**
    *   Given I am on the Next.js frontend,
    *   When I navigate to the registration route (e.g., `/register`),
    *   Then I should see a registration form with fields for username, email, password, and password confirmation.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Given I am on the registration form,
    *   When I enter invalid data (e.g., weak password, invalid email format, mismatched passwords),
    *   Then the form should display appropriate validation error messages without submitting the form.
*   **Successful Registration:**
    *   Given I am on the registration form,
    *   When I provide valid and unique registration details,
    *   Then the frontend should send a POST request to the `@user-management-service` registration API endpoint.
    *   And upon successful registration, I should be redirected to a login or confirmation page.
    *   And a success message should be displayed.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Given I am on the registration form,
    *   When the backend API returns an error (e.g., email already exists, server error),
    *   Then the frontend should display a clear and user-friendly error message.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

*   **UI/UX:** The registration form should be intuitive, visually appealing, and consistent with Material-UI guidelines.
*   **Performance:** The form submission and API call should be responsive.
*   **Security:** Password fields should be masked, and sensitive data handled securely.
*   **Testability:** The registration component and its API integration should be testable using TDD principles.

## Dev Notes

### File Locations
*   The Next.js frontend application will reside in a new top-level directory named `frontend/`.
*   The registration form component will be located within this `frontend/` directory (e.g., `frontend/components/auth/RegistrationForm.tsx`).

### Data Models
*   **User Registration Data Model (UserCreate Schema):**
    *   `email`: string (required, valid email format)
    *   `username`: string (required, min_length=3, max_length=50)
    *   `password`: string (required, min_length=8)
    *   `full_name`: string (optional, max_length=100)
    *   Source: `user-management-service/app/schemas/user.py`

### Environment Variables
*   `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the backend API (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`).

## 4. Technical Details

*   **Frontend Component:** A dedicated React component for the registration form.
*   **State Management:** Redux Toolkit for local form state and RTK Query for API interaction.
*   **HTTP Client:** Axios for making the POST request to the backend.
*   **UI Library:** Material-UI components for form elements and layout.
*   **API Endpoint:** `@user-management-service` registration endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/users/register`).
*   **Testing:** Unit tests for component logic and integration tests for API interaction.

## 5. Dependencies

*   The `@user-management-service` backend registration API must be functional and accessible.
*   Basic Next.js project setup and Material-UI integration.

## 6. Estimation

*   **Size:** Small to Medium
*   **Effort:** [To be estimated by the development team]

## 7. Definition of Done

*   All acceptance criteria are met.
*   Code is reviewed and approved.
*   All automated tests pass.
*   The registration form is fully functional and integrated into the Next.js application.
*   UI/UX is validated and approved.
*   Documentation for the registration component is updated.
