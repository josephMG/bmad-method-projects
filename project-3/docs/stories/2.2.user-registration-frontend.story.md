## Story
**As a** new user,
**I want** to register for an account through the Next.js frontend,
**so that** I can gain access to the user management features.

This story focuses on implementing the user registration functionality within the Next.js frontend. It will involve creating a registration form, handling user input, and making an API call to the `@user-management-service` backend's registration endpoint. The frontend will provide clear feedback to the user during the registration process, including validation errors and success messages. The UI will be built using Material-UI components.

## Status
Draft

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:

*   **Registration Form Display:**
    *   Given I am on the Next.js frontend,
    *   When I navigate to the registration route (e.g., `/register`),
    *   Then I should see a registration form with fields for username, email, password, and password confirmation.
    *   And the form elements should adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards, including proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Given I am on the registration form,
    *   When I enter invalid data (e.g., weak password, invalid email format, mismatched passwords),
    *   Then the form should display appropriate validation error messages without submitting the form, adhering to client-side validation guidelines in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Successful Registration:**
    *   Given I am on the registration form,
    *   When I provide valid and unique registration details,
    *   Then the frontend should send a POST request to the `/api/v1/register` endpoint as defined in `ui-spec.md`.
    *   And upon successful registration, I should be redirected to a login or confirmation page.
    *   And a success message should be displayed.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Given I am on the registration form,
    *   When the backend API returns an error (e.g., email already exists, server error),
    *   Then the frontend should display a clear and user-friendly error message.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

*   **UI/UX:** The registration form should be intuitive, visually appealing, and consistent with Material-UI guidelines. It must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards and be fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints, as detailed in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Performance:** The form submission and API call should be responsive, leveraging optimization strategies like code splitting and bundle size reduction as outlined in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Security:** Password fields should be masked, and sensitive data handled securely. Input validation and sanitization, as well as XSS prevention measures, should be implemented as described in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Testability:** The registration component and its API integration should be testable using TDD principles.

## Dev Notes

### File Locations
*   The Next.js frontend application will reside in a new top-level directory named `nextjs-frontend/`.
*   The registration form component will be located within this `nextjs-frontend/` directory (e.g., `nextjs-frontend/components/auth/RegistrationForm.tsx`).

### Data Models
*   **User Registration Data Model (UserCreate Schema):**
    ```python
    class UserCreate(UserBase):
        email: EmailStr = Field(..., example="user@example.com")
        username: str = Field(..., min_length=3, max_length=50, example="testuser")
        full_name: str | None = Field(None, max_length=100, example="Test User")
        password: str = Field(..., min_length=8, example="a_strong_password")
    ```
    (Source: `user-management-service/app/schemas/user.py`)

### Environment Variables
*   `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the backend API (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`).

### UI/UX Specifications (from ui-spec.md)

#### User Registration Flow
-   **Start:** User navigates to `/register`.
-   **Action:** User fills out registration form (username, email, password, confirm password).
-   **Validation:** Client-side validation for format, strength, and matching passwords.
-   **Action:** User submits form.
-   **System:** Frontend sends POST request to `/api/v1/register`.
-   **System:** Backend processes registration, creates user, returns success/error.
-   **Frontend:** Displays success message or validation errors from backend.
-   **End:** Redirects to login page or confirmation page on success.

#### Visual Design and Branding
-   **Material Design:** Adhere to Material-UI guidelines for components, spacing, and overall visual language.
-   **Clean and Modern:** Emphasize a clean, modern aesthetic with clear hierarchy and intuitive layouts.
-   **Accessibility:** Ensure color contrasts, font sizes, and interactive elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

#### Accessibility and Usability
-   **WCAG 2.1 AA:** All frontend development and design must adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA.
-   **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML5 semantic elements to convey meaning and structure.
-   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are navigable and operable via keyboard.
-   **Focus Management:** Provide clear visual focus indicators for interactive elements.
-   **ARIA Attributes:** Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes where semantic HTML is insufficient.
-   **Color Contrast:** Maintain sufficient color contrast ratios for text and interactive elements.
-   **Alternative Text:** Provide descriptive `alt` text for all meaningful images.
-   **Form Labels:** Ensure all form fields have associated, descriptive labels.
-   **Error Identification:** Clearly communicate form validation errors and provide guidance for correction.

#### Performance Optimization
-   **Code Splitting:** Leverage Next.js's automatic code splitting to load only the necessary code for each page.
-   **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js Image component for automatic image optimization (lazy loading, responsive images, modern formats).
-   **Lazy Loading:** Lazy load components, routes, and resources that are not immediately needed.
-   **Caching:** Implement effective caching strategies for API responses and static assets.
-   **Bundle Size Reduction:** Minimize JavaScript, CSS, and other asset sizes through tree-shaking, minification, and compression.
-   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Static Site Generation (SSG):** Utilize Next.js's rendering strategies to deliver pre-rendered content for faster initial loads.

#### Error Handling and Feedback
-   **Client-Side Validation:** Implement robust client-side form validation to prevent invalid data from being submitted.
-   **API Error Handling:** Use RTK Query's error handling capabilities (e.g., `onQueryStarted` or custom `baseQuery`) to catch and process API errors globally.
-   **User Feedback Mechanisms:** Toast Notifications for transient messages, Alerts/Banners for critical messages, Inline Error Messages for form validation, Loading Indicators for async operations, Empty States for no content.

#### Security Considerations
-   **JWT Handling:** Securely store and transmit JWTs (e.g., HTTP-only cookies for server-side rendering, or local storage with appropriate precautions).
-   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Implement comprehensive client-side form validation and properly encode all user-generated content before rendering to prevent XSS attacks.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:** Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) and use sanitization libraries.
-   **Sensitive Data Handling:** Never store API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive secrets directly in client-side code.

### Testing
List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:
- Test file location: `nextjs-frontend/tests/unit/` for unit tests, `nextjs-frontend/tests/integration/` for integration tests.
- Test standards: Follow TDD principles (Red-Green-Refactor cycle). Use Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: Vitest and React Testing Library for unit tests. Playwright for E2E tests (post-MVP).
