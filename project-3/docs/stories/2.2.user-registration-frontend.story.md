## Story
**As a** new user,
**I want** to register for an account through the Next.js frontend,
**so that** I can gain access to the user management features.

This story focuses on implementing the user registration functionality within the Next.js frontend. It will involve creating a registration form, handling user input, and making an API call to the `@user-management-service` backend's registration endpoint. The frontend will provide clear feedback to the user during the registration process, including validation errors and success messages. The UI will be built using Material-UI components.

## Status
Done

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:

*   **Registration Form Display:**
    *   Given I am on the Next.js frontend,
    *   When I navigate to the registration route (e.g., `/register`),
    *   Then I should see a registration form with fields for username, email, password, and password confirmation.
    *   And the form elements should adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards, including proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Given I am on the registration form,
    *   When I enter invalid data (e.g., weak password, invalid email format, mismatched passwords),
    *   Then the form should display appropriate validation error messages without submitting the form, adhering to client-side validation guidelines in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Successful Registration:**
    *   Given I am on the registration form,
    *   When I provide valid and unique registration details,
    *   Then the frontend should send a POST request to the `/api/v1/register` endpoint as defined in `ui-spec.md`.
    *   And upon successful registration, I should be redirected to a login or confirmation page.
    *   And a success message should be displayed.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Given I am on the registration form,
    *   When the backend API returns an error (e.g., email already exists, server error),
    *   Then the frontend should display a clear and user-friendly error message.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

*   **UI/UX:** The registration form should be intuitive, visually appealing, and consistent with Material-UI guidelines. It must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards and be fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints, as detailed in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Performance:** The form submission and API call should be responsive, leveraging optimization strategies like code splitting and bundle size reduction as outlined in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Security:** Password fields should be masked, and sensitive data handled securely. Input validation and sanitization, as well as XSS prevention measures, should be implemented as described in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Testability:** The registration component and its API integration should be testable using TDD principles.

## Dev Notes

### File Locations
*   The Next.js frontend application will reside in a new top-level directory named `nextjs-frontend/`.
*   The registration form component will be located within this `nextjs-frontend/` directory (e.g., `nextjs-frontend/components/auth/RegistrationForm.tsx`).

### Data Models
*   **User Registration Data Model (UserCreate Schema):**
    ```python
    class UserCreate(UserBase):
        email: EmailStr = Field(..., example="user@example.com")
        username: str = Field(..., min_length=3, max_length=50, example="testuser")
        full_name: str | None = Field(None, max_length=100, example="Test User")
        password: str = Field(..., min_length=8, example="a_strong_password")
    ```
    (Source: `user-management-service/app/schemas/user.py`)

### Environment Variables
*   `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the backend API (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`).

### UI/UX Specifications (from ui-spec.md)

#### User Registration Flow
-   **Start:** User navigates to `/register`.
-   **Action:** User fills out registration form (username, email, password, confirm password).
-   **Validation:** Client-side validation for format, strength, and matching passwords.
-   **Action:** User submits form.
-   **System:** Frontend sends POST request to `/api/v1/register`.
-   **System:** Backend processes registration, creates user, returns success/error.
-   **Frontend:** Displays success message or validation errors from backend.
-   **End:** Redirects to login page or confirmation page on success.

#### Visual Design and Branding
-   **Material Design:** Adhere to Material-UI guidelines for components, spacing, and overall visual language.
-   **Clean and Modern:** Emphasize a clean, modern aesthetic with clear hierarchy and intuitive layouts.
-   **Accessibility:** Ensure color contrasts, font sizes, and interactive elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

#### Accessibility and Usability
-   **WCAG 2.1 AA:** All frontend development and design must adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA.
-   **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML5 semantic elements to convey meaning and structure.
-   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are navigable and operable via keyboard.
-   **Focus Management:** Provide clear visual focus indicators for interactive elements.
-   **ARIA Attributes:** Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes where semantic HTML is insufficient.
-   **Color Contrast:** Maintain sufficient color contrast ratios for text and interactive elements.
-   **Alternative Text:** Provide descriptive `alt` text for all meaningful images.
-   **Form Labels:** Ensure all form fields have associated, descriptive labels.
-   **Error Identification:** Clearly communicate form validation errors and provide guidance for correction.

#### Performance Optimization
-   **Code Splitting:** Leverage Next.js's automatic code splitting to load only the necessary code for each page.
-   **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js Image component for automatic image optimization (lazy loading, responsive images, modern formats).
-   **Lazy Loading:** Lazy load components, routes, and resources that are not immediately needed.
-   **Caching:** Implement effective caching strategies for API responses and static assets.
-   **Bundle Size Reduction:** Minimize JavaScript, CSS, and other asset sizes through tree-shaking, minification, and compression.
-   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Static Site Generation (SSG):** Utilize Next.js's rendering strategies to deliver pre-rendered content for faster initial loads.

#### Error Handling and Feedback
-   **Client-Side Validation:** Implement robust client-side form validation to prevent invalid data from being submitted.
-   **API Error Handling:** Use RTK Query's error handling capabilities (e.g., `onQueryStarted` or custom `baseQuery`) to catch and process API errors globally.
-   **User Feedback Mechanisms:** Toast Notifications for transient messages, Alerts/Banners for critical messages, Inline Error Messages for form validation, Loading Indicators for async operations, Empty States for no content.

#### Security Considerations
-   **JWT Handling:** Securely store and transmit JWTs (e.g., HTTP-only cookies for server-side rendering, or local storage with appropriate precautions).
-   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Implement comprehensive client-side form validation and properly encode all user-generated content before rendering to prevent XSS attacks.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:** Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) and use sanitization libraries.
-   **Sensitive Data Handling:** Never store API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive secrets directly in client-side code.

### Testing
List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:
- Test file location: `nextjs-frontend/tests/unit/` for unit tests, `nextjs-frontend/tests/integration/` for integration tests.
- Test standards: Follow TDD principles (Red-Green-Refactor cycle). Use Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-28

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Overall Assessment:
The developer has made significant progress in addressing the previous QA feedback. The implementation of explicit test cases for JWT handling, enhanced accessibility checks with ARIA attributes, and the documentation of the UI/UX validation process have substantially improved the quality and testability of the story. All automated tests are passing, and linting issues have been resolved.

### Refactoring Performed:
- **File**: `nextjs-frontend/src/components/auth/RegistrationForm.tsx`
  - **Change**: Replaced `any` type with `ApiError` interface for error handling.
  - **Why**: To improve type safety and adhere to TypeScript best practices, resolving a linting error.
  - **How**: Defined a specific interface for API error responses and cast the error object to this type.
- **File**: `nextjs-frontend/src/components/auth/RegistrationForm.tsx`
  - **Change**: Removed unused `Typography` import.
  - **Why**: To clean up the code and resolve a linting warning about unused imports.
  - **How**: Deleted the `Typography` import statement.

### Compliance Check:
- Coding Standards: [✓] (Linting issues resolved)
- Project Structure: [✓] (Adheres to defined structure)
- Testing Strategy: [✓] (Aligned with stated strategy, improved traceability)
- All ACs Met: [✓] (Functional ACs met, NFR validation significantly improved)

### Improvements Checklist:
- [x] Add explicit mapping of GWT acceptance criteria to test cases for improved traceability. (Addressed by traceability comments in tests)
- [x] Implement specific test cases or metrics for Performance NFR validation. (Basic render time test present)
- [x] Implement specific test cases for Security NFR validation (e.g., XSS, JWT handling). (XSS and JWT handling tests added)
