# User Story: User Login Frontend

## 1. Title

As a registered user, I want to log in securely through the Next.js frontend, so that I can access my account and manage my profile.

## 2. Description

This story focuses on implementing the user login functionality within the Next.js frontend. It will involve creating a login form, handling user credentials, and making an API call to the `@user-management-service` backend's login endpoint to obtain a JWT token. The frontend will securely store this token and use it for subsequent authenticated requests. Clear feedback will be provided to the user during the login process, including validation errors and success messages. The UI will be built using Material-UI components.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:

*   **Login Form Display:**
    *   Given I am on the Next.js frontend,
    *   When I navigate to the login route (e.g., `/login`),
    *   Then I should see a login form with fields for username/email and password.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Given I am on the login form,
    *   When I enter invalid data (e.g., incorrect format for username/email, empty password),
    *   Then the form should display appropriate validation error messages without submitting the form.
*   **Successful Login & JWT Handling:**
    *   Given I am on the login form,
    *   When I provide valid login credentials,
    *   Then the frontend should send a POST request to the `@user-management-service` login API endpoint.
    *   And upon successful login, the frontend should receive a JWT token from the backend.
    *   And the JWT token should be securely stored (e.g., in HTTP-only cookies or local storage with appropriate security measures).
    *   And I should be redirected to a dashboard or profile page.
    *   And a success message should be displayed.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Given I am on the login form,
    *   When the backend API returns an error (e.g., invalid credentials, server error),
    *   Then the frontend should display a clear and user-friendly error message.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

*   **UI/UX:** The login form should be intuitive, visually appealing, and consistent with Material-UI guidelines.
*   **Performance:** The form submission and API call should be responsive.
*   **Security:** Password fields should be masked, and the JWT token should be handled securely to prevent XSS/CSRF attacks.
*   **Testability:** The login component and its API integration should be testable using TDD principles.

## 4. Technical Details

*   **Frontend Component:** A dedicated React component for the login form.
*   **State Management:** Redux Toolkit for local form state and RTK Query for API interaction.
*   **HTTP Client:** Axios for making the POST request to the backend.
*   **UI Library:** Material-UI components for form elements and layout.
*   **API Endpoint:** `@user-management-service` login endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/auth/login`).
*   **Testing:** Unit tests for component logic and integration tests for API interaction.
*   **Token Storage:** Implementation for secure storage and retrieval of the JWT token.

## 5. Dependencies

*   The `@user-management-service` backend login API must be functional and accessible.
*   Basic Next.js project setup and Material-UI integration.

## 6. Estimation

*   **Size:** Small to Medium
*   **Effort:** [To be estimated by the development team]

## Dev Notes

### Important Considerations:
*   This story is dependent on the successful completion of Story 2.1 (Next.js Frontend Dockerization and Docker-compose Integration). Ensure the frontend application is properly set up and integrated into `docker-compose.yml` before starting this story.
*   Pay close attention to the secure handling and storage of the JWT token as per the Acceptance Criteria.
