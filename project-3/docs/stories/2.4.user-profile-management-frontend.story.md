# User Story: User Profile Management Frontend

## 1. Title

As a logged-in user, I want to view and update my profile information through the Next.js frontend, so that I can keep my personal details current.

## 2. Description

This story focuses on implementing the functionality for logged-in users to view and update their profile information within the Next.js frontend. It will involve fetching the user's current details from the `@user-management-service` backend, displaying them in an editable form, and allowing the user to submit changes. The frontend will handle form submission, API calls for updating the profile, and provide appropriate feedback. The UI will be built using Material-UI components.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:

*   **View Profile Display:**
    *   Given I am logged in,
    *   When I navigate to my profile page (e.g., `/profile`),
    *   Then I should see my current user details (e.g., username, email, name) pre-filled in an editable form, fetched from the backend API.
*   **Update Profile Form:**
    *   Given I am on my profile page,
    *   When I modify my user details (e.g., name, email) in the form,
    *   Then the form should allow me to submit these changes.
*   **Input Validation for Update:**
    *   Given I am on the profile update form,
    *   When I enter invalid data (e.g., invalid email format, empty required fields),
    *   Then the form should display appropriate validation error messages without submitting the form.
*   **Successful Profile Update:**
    *   Given I am on my profile page and have made valid changes,
    *   When I submit the updated information,
    *   Then the frontend should send a PUT/PATCH request to the `@user-management-service` update user API endpoint with the updated details.
    *   And upon successful update, a success message should be displayed.
    *   And the displayed profile information should reflect the changes.
*   **Error Handling for Update:**
    *   Given I am on my profile page,
    *   When the backend API returns an error during an update (e.g., email already exists, server error),
    *   Then the frontend should display a clear and user-friendly error message.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

*   **UI/UX:** The profile page should be intuitive, visually appealing, and consistent with Material-UI guidelines, clearly distinguishing editable fields.
*   **Performance:** Fetching and updating profile information should be responsive.
*   **Security:** Sensitive user data should be handled securely during display and submission.
*   **Testability:** The profile management component and its API integrations should be testable using TDD principles.

## 4. Technical Details

*   **Frontend Component:** A dedicated React component for viewing and updating the user profile.
*   **State Management:** Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for fetching and updating user data.
*   **HTTP Client:** Axios for making GET and PUT/PATCH requests to the backend.
*   **UI Library:** Material-UI components for form elements, display, and layout.
*   **API Endpoints:** `@user-management-service` get user details endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/users/{user_id}`) and update user endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/users/{user_id}`).
*   **Testing:** Unit tests for component logic and integration tests for API interaction.

## 5. Dependencies

*   The `@user-management-service` backend get user details and update user APIs must be functional and accessible.
*   User Login functionality must be implemented and working to provide authentication.

## 6. Estimation

*   **Size:** Medium
*   **Effort:** [To be estimated by the development team]

## 7. Definition of Done

## Dev Notes

### Important Considerations:
*   This story is dependent on the successful completion of Story 2.1 (Next.js Frontend Dockerization and Docker-compose Integration) and Story 2.3 (User Login Frontend). Ensure the frontend application is set up and the user can log in before starting this story.
*   Pay close attention to securely fetching, displaying, and updating user profile data, especially regarding authorization for the logged-in user.
*   Refer to the backend API documentation for the specific endpoints and data structures for fetching and updating user profiles.
