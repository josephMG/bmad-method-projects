## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to view and update my profile information through the Next.js frontend,
**so that** I can keep my personal details current.

This story focuses on implementing the functionality for logged-in users to view and update their profile information within the Next.js frontend. It will involve fetching the user's current details from the `@user-management-service` backend, displaying them in an editable form, and allowing the user to submit changes. The frontend will handle form submission, API calls for updating the profile, and provide appropriate feedback. The UI will be built using Material-UI components.

## Status
Done

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:

*   **View Profile Display:**
    *   Given I am logged in,
    *   When I navigate to my profile page (e.g., `/dashboard/settings/profile` as per `ui-spec.md`),
    *   Then I should see my current user details (e.g., username, email, name) pre-filled in an editable form, fetched from the backend API.
    *   And the form elements should adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards, including proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support.
*   **Update Profile Form:**
    *   Given I am on my profile page,
    *   When I modify my user details (e.g., name, email) in the form,
    *   Then the form should allow me to submit these changes.
*   **Input Validation for Update:**
    *   Given I am on the profile update form,
    *   When I enter invalid data (e.g., invalid email format, empty required fields),
    *   Then the form should display appropriate validation error messages without submitting the form, adhering to client-side validation guidelines in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Successful Profile Update:**
    *   Given I am on my profile page and have made valid changes,
    *   When I submit the updated information,
    *   Then the frontend should send a PUT/PATCH request to the `/api/v1/users/me` endpoint as defined in `ui-spec.md` with the updated details.
    *   And upon successful update, a success message should be displayed.
    *   And the displayed profile information should reflect the changes.
*   **Error Handling for Update:**
    *   Given I am on my profile page,
    *   When the backend API returns an error during an update (e.g., email already exists, server error),
    *   Then the frontend should display a clear and user-friendly error message.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

*   **UI/UX:** The profile management interface should be intuitive, visually appealing, and consistent with Material-UI guidelines. It must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards and be fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints, as detailed in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Performance:** Profile data loading and update operations should be responsive, leveraging optimization strategies like code splitting and bundle size reduction as outlined in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Security:** Sensitive profile data should be handled securely, and unauthorized access prevented. Input validation and sanitization, as well as XSS prevention measures, should be implemented as described in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Testability:** The profile management components and their API integrations should be testable using TDD principles.

## Dev Notes

### File Locations
*   The Next.js frontend application will reside in a new top-level directory named `nextjs-frontend/`.
*   The profile management components will be located within this `nextjs-frontend/` directory (e.g., `nextjs-frontend/components/profile/ProfileForm.tsx`).

### Data Models
*   **User Profile Data Model (UserRead Schema):**
    ```python
    class UserRead(UserBase):
        id: UUID
        email: EmailStr = Field(..., example="user@example.com")
        username: str = Field(..., min_length=3, max_length=50, example="testuser")
        full_name: str | None = Field(None, max_length=100, example="Test User")
        is_active: bool
        created_at: datetime.datetime
        updated_at: datetime.datetime
    ```
*   **User Profile Data Model (UserUpdate Schema):**
    ```python
    class UserUpdate(BaseModel):
        full_name: str | None = Field(None, max_length=100, example="Updated User Name")
        email: EmailStr | None = Field(None, example="updated_email@example.com")
    ```
    (Source: `user-management-service/app/schemas/user.py`)

### Environment Variables
*   `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the backend API (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`).

### UI/UX Specifications (from ui-spec.md)

#### User Profile Management Flow
-   **Start:** Logged-in user navigates to `/dashboard/settings/profile`.
-   **System:** Frontend fetches user profile data from `/api/v1/users/me`.
-   **Frontend:** Displays current user details in an editable form.
-   **Action:** User modifies profile details (e.g., full name, email).
-   **Validation:** Client-side validation for format and uniqueness (for email).
-   **Action:** User submits form.
-   **System:** Frontend sends PUT/PATCH request to `/api/v1/users/me`.
-   **System:** Backend updates profile, returns updated user data or error.
-   **Frontend:** Displays success message or error, updates displayed profile.
-   **End:** Profile updated.

#### Visual Design and Branding
-   **Material Design:** Adhere to Material-UI guidelines for components, spacing, and overall visual language.
-   **Clean and Modern:** Emphasize a clean, modern aesthetic with clear hierarchy and intuitive layouts.
-   **Accessibility:** Ensure color contrasts, font sizes, and interactive elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

#### Accessibility and Usability
-   **WCAG 2.1 AA:** All frontend development and design must adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA.
-   **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML5 semantic elements to convey meaning and structure.
-   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are navigable and operable via keyboard.
-   **Focus Management:** Provide clear visual focus indicators for interactive elements.
-   **ARIA Attributes:** Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes where semantic HTML is insufficient.
-   **Color Contrast:** Maintain sufficient color contrast ratios for text and interactive elements.
-   **Alternative Text:** Provide descriptive `alt` text for all meaningful images.
-   **Form Labels:** Ensure all form fields have associated, descriptive labels.
-   **Error Identification:** Clearly communicate form validation errors and provide guidance for correction.

#### Performance Optimization
-   **Code Splitting:** Leverage Next.js's automatic code splitting to load only the necessary code for each page.
-   **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js Image component for automatic image optimization (lazy loading, responsive images, modern formats).
-   **Lazy Loading:** Lazy load components, routes, and resources that are not immediately needed.
-   **Caching:** Implement effective caching strategies for API responses and static assets.
-   **Bundle Size Reduction:** Minimize JavaScript, CSS, and other asset sizes through tree-shaking, minification, and compression.
-   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Static Site Generation (SSG):** Utilize Next.js's rendering strategies to deliver pre-rendered content for faster initial loads.

#### Error Handling and Feedback
-   **Client-Side Validation:** Implement robust client-side form validation to prevent invalid data from being submitted.
-   **API Error Handling:** Use RTK Query's error handling capabilities (e.g., `onQueryStarted` or custom `baseQuery`) to catch and process API errors globally.
-   **User Feedback Mechanisms:** Toast Notifications for transient messages, Alerts/Banners for critical messages, Inline Error Messages for form validation, Loading Indicators for async operations, Empty States for no content.

#### Security Considerations
-   **Authentication & Authorization:** Securely store and transmit JWTs (e.g., HTTP-only cookies for server-side rendering, or local storage with appropriate precautions). Implement robust client-side and server-side checks for protected routes.
-   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Implement comprehensive client-side form validation and properly encode all user-generated content before rendering to prevent XSS attacks.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:** Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) and use sanitization libraries.
-   **Sensitive Data Handling:** Never store API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive secrets directly in client-side code.
