# User Story: Change Password Frontend

## 1. Title

As a logged-in user, I want to change my password through the Next.js frontend, so that I can maintain the security of my account.

## 2. Description

This story focuses on implementing the functionality for logged-in users to change their password within the Next.js frontend. It will involve creating a form for current and new password input, handling user input, and making an API call to the `@user-management-service` backend's change password endpoint. The frontend will provide clear feedback to the user during the password change process, including validation errors and success messages. The UI will be built using Material-UI components.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:

*   **Change Password Form Display:**
    *   Given I am logged in,
    *   When I navigate to the change password section (e.g., `/profile/change-password`),
    *   Then I should see a form with fields for current password, new password, and confirm new password.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Given I am on the change password form,
    *   When I enter invalid data (e.g., weak new password, mismatched new passwords, incorrect current password),
    *   Then the form should display appropriate validation error messages without submitting the form.
*   **Successful Password Change:**
    *   Given I am on the change password form,
    *   When I provide my correct current password and a new valid password (with confirmation),
    *   Then the frontend should send a PUT/PATCH request to the `@user-management-service` change password API endpoint.
    *   And upon successful password change, a success message should be displayed.
    *   And I should be prompted to re-login or automatically logged out for security reasons (to be confirmed with PO/Security).
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Given I am on the change password form,
    *   When the backend API returns an error (e.g., incorrect current password, server error),
    *   Then the frontend should display a clear and user-friendly error message.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

*   **UI/UX:** The change password form should be intuitive, visually appealing, and consistent with Material-UI guidelines.
*   **Performance:** The form submission and API call should be responsive.
*   **Security:** All password fields should be masked, and the new password should meet defined strength requirements (as per backend validation).
*   **Testability:** The change password component and its API integration should be testable using TDD principles.

## 4. Technical Details

*   **Frontend Component:** A dedicated React component for the change password form.
*   **State Management:** Redux Toolkit for local form state and RTK Query for API interaction.
*   **HTTP Client:** Axios for making the PUT/PATCH request to the backend.
*   **UI Library:** Material-UI components for form elements and layout.
*   **API Endpoint:** `@user-management-service` change password endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/users/change-password`).
*   **Testing:** Unit tests for component logic and integration tests for API interaction.

## 5. Dependencies

*   The `@user-management-service` backend change password API must be functional and accessible.
*   User Login functionality must be implemented and working to provide authentication.

## 6. Estimation

*   **Size:** Small to Medium
*   **Effort:** [To be estimated by the development team]

## 7. Definition of Done

*   All acceptance criteria are met.
*   Code is reviewed and approved.
*   All automated tests pass.
*   The change password functionality is fully integrated into the Next.js application.
*   UI/UX is validated and approved.
*   Documentation for the change password component is updated.

## Dev Notes

### Important Considerations:
*   This story is dependent on the successful completion of Story 2.1 (Next.js Frontend Dockerization and Docker-compose Integration) and Story 2.3 (User Login Frontend). Ensure the frontend application is set up and the user can log in before starting this story.
*   Strictly adhere to security best practices for handling current and new passwords, including client-side validation and secure transmission to the backend.
*   Confirm the desired behavior after a successful password change: whether the user should be prompted to re-login or automatically logged out for security reasons.
