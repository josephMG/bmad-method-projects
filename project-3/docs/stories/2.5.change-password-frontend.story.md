## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to change my password through the Next.js frontend,
**so that** I can maintain the security of my account.

This story focuses on implementing the password change functionality within the Next.js frontend. It will involve creating a form for users to enter their current and new passwords, handling user input, and making an API call to the `@user-management-service` backend's password change endpoint. The frontend will provide clear feedback to the user during the process, including validation errors and success messages. The UI will be built using Material-UI components.

## Status
Draft

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:

*   **Change Password Form Display:**
    *   Given I am logged in,
    *   When I navigate to the change password section (e.g., `/dashboard/settings/change-password` as per `ui-spec.md`),
    *   Then I should see a form with fields for current password, new password, and confirm new password.
    *   And the form elements should adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards, including proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support.
*   **Input Validation:**
    *   Given I am on the change password form,
    *   When I enter invalid data (e.g., weak new password, mismatched new passwords, incorrect current password),
    *   Then the form should display appropriate validation error messages without submitting the form, adhering to client-side validation guidelines in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Successful Password Change:**
    *   Given I am on the change password form,
    *   When I provide my correct current password and a new valid password (with confirmation),
    *   Then the frontend should send a PUT/PATCH request to the `/api/v1/users/me/password` endpoint as defined in `ui-spec.md`.
    *   And upon successful password change, a success message should be displayed.
    *   And I should be prompted to re-login or automatically logged out for security reasons (to be confirmed with PO/Security).
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Given I am on the change password form,
    *   When the backend API returns an error (e.g., incorrect current password, server error),
    *   Then the frontend should display a clear and user-friendly error message.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

*   **UI/UX:** The password change interface should be intuitive, visually appealing, and consistent with Material-UI guidelines. It must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards and be fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints, as detailed in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Performance:** The password change operation should be responsive, leveraging optimization strategies like code splitting and bundle size reduction as outlined in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Security:** Password fields should be masked, and sensitive data handled securely. Password complexity rules should be enforced. Input validation and sanitization, as well as XSS prevention measures, should be implemented as described in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Testability:** The password change components and their API integrations should be testable using TDD principles.

## Dev Notes

### File Locations
*   The Next.js frontend application will reside in a new top-level directory named `nextjs-frontend/`.
*   The change password components will be located within this `nextjs-frontend/` directory (e.g., `nextjs-frontend/components/auth/ChangePasswordForm.tsx`).

### Data Models
*   **Password Change Data Model (PasswordUpdate Schema):**
    ```python
    class PasswordUpdate(BaseModel):
        current_password: str = Field(..., example="CurrentSecurePassword123")
        new_password: str = Field(..., min_length=8, example="NewSecurePassword456")
    ```
    (Source: `user-management-service/app/schemas/user.py`)

### Environment Variables
*   `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the backend API (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`).

### UI/UX Specifications (from ui-spec.md)

#### Change Password Flow
-   **Start:** Logged-in user navigates to `/dashboard/settings/change-password`.
-   **Action:** User fills out form (current password, new password, confirm new password).
-   **Validation:** Client-side validation for new password strength, matching new passwords.
-   **Action:** User submits form.
-   **System:** Frontend sends PUT/PATCH request to `/api/v1/users/me/password`.
-   **System:** Backend validates current password, updates new password, returns success/error.
-   **Frontend:** Displays success message or error.
-   **End:** User prompted to re-login or automatically logged out.

#### Visual Design and Branding
-   **Material Design:** Adhere to Material-UI guidelines for components, spacing, and overall visual language.
-   **Clean and Modern:** Emphasize a clean, modern aesthetic with clear hierarchy and intuitive layouts.
-   **Accessibility:** Ensure color contrasts, font sizes, and interactive elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

#### Accessibility and Usability
-   **WCAG 2.1 AA:** All frontend development and design must adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA.
-   **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML5 semantic elements to convey meaning and structure.
-   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are navigable and operable via keyboard.
-   **Focus Management:** Provide clear visual focus indicators for interactive elements.
-   **ARIA Attributes:** Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) attributes where semantic HTML is insufficient.
-   **Color Contrast:** Maintain sufficient color contrast ratios for text and interactive elements.
-   **Alternative Text:** Provide descriptive `alt` text for all meaningful images.
-   **Form Labels:** Ensure all form fields have associated, descriptive labels.
-   **Error Identification:** Clearly communicate form validation errors and provide guidance for correction.

#### Performance Optimization
-   **Code Splitting:** Leverage Next.js's automatic code splitting to load only the necessary code for each page.
-   **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js Image component for automatic image optimization (lazy loading, responsive images, modern formats).
-   **Lazy Loading:** Lazy load components, routes, and resources that are not immediately needed.
-   **Caching:** Implement effective caching strategies for API responses and static assets.
-   **Bundle Size Reduction:** Minimize JavaScript, CSS, and other asset sizes through tree-shaking, minification, and compression.
-   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Static Site Generation (SSG):** Utilize Next.js's rendering strategies to deliver pre-rendered content for faster initial loads.

#### Error Handling and Feedback
-   **Client-Side Validation:** Implement robust client-side form validation to prevent invalid data from being submitted.
-   **API Error Handling:** Use RTK Query's error handling capabilities (e.g., `onQueryStarted` or custom `baseQuery`) to catch and process API errors globally.
-   **User Feedback Mechanisms:** Toast Notifications for transient messages, Alerts/Banners for critical messages, Inline Error Messages for form validation, Loading Indicators for async operations, Empty States for no content.

#### Security Considerations
-   **Authentication & Authorization:** Securely store and transmit JWTs (e.g., HTTP-only cookies for server-side rendering, or local storage with appropriate precautions). Implement robust client-side and server-side checks for protected routes.
-   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Implement comprehensive client-side form validation and properly encode all user-generated content before rendering to prevent XSS attacks.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:** Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) and use sanitization libraries.
-   **Sensitive Data Handling:** Never store API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive secrets directly in client-side code.

### Testing
List Relevant Testing Standards from Architecture the Developer needs to conform to:
- Test file location: `nextjs-frontend/tests/unit/` for unit tests, `nextjs-frontend/tests/integration/` for integration tests.
- Test standards: Follow TDD principles (Red-Green-Refactor cycle). Use Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.
- Testing frameworks and patterns to use: Vitest and React Testing Library for unit tests. Playwright for E2E tests (post-MVP).
- Any specific testing requirements for this story: Ensure comprehensive unit tests for component logic and integration tests for API interaction.
