## Story
**As a** logged-in user,
**I want** to delete my account through the Next.js frontend,
**so that** I can remove my personal data from the system.

This story focuses on implementing the user account deletion functionality within the Next.js frontend. It will involve providing a clear and secure mechanism for users to initiate account deletion, handling user confirmation, and making an API call to the `@user-management-service` backend's account deletion endpoint. The frontend will provide appropriate warnings and feedback to the user during the process. The UI will be built using Material-UI components.

## Status
Draft

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:

*   **Account Deletion Option Display:**
    *   Given I am logged in,
    *   When I navigate to the account settings or profile management section (e.g., `/dashboard/settings/delete-account` as per `ui-spec.md`),
    *   Then I should see a clearly labeled option to delete my account.
    *   And the option should adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards, including proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support.
*   **Deletion Confirmation:**
    *   Given I have initiated the account deletion process,
    *   When I am presented with a confirmation dialog or page,
    *   Then I must explicitly confirm my intention to delete the account (e.g., by re-entering password, typing a confirmation phrase), adhering to client-side validation guidelines in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Successful Account Deletion:**
    *   Given I have confirmed my account deletion,
    *   When the frontend sends a DELETE request to the `/api/v1/users/me` endpoint as defined in `ui-spec.md`,
    *   Then upon successful deletion, a success message should be displayed.
    *   And I should be automatically logged out and redirected to the home or login page.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Given I am attempting to delete my account,
    *   When the backend API returns an error (e.g., server error, unauthorized),
    *   Then the frontend should display a clear and user-friendly error message.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

*   **UI/UX:** The account deletion interface should be clear, intuitive, and consistent with Material-UI guidelines, emphasizing the gravity of the action. It must adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards and be fully responsive across desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints, as detailed in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Performance:** The account deletion operation should be responsive, leveraging optimization strategies like code splitting and bundle size reduction as outlined in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Security:** Account deletion must be securely authenticated and authorized. Sensitive data handling during deletion should adhere to privacy policies. Input validation and sanitization, as well as XSS prevention measures, should be implemented as described in `ui-spec.md`.
*   **Testability:** The account deletion components and their API integrations should be testable using TDD principles.

## Dev Notes

### Important Considerations:
*   This story is dependent on the successful completion of Story 2.1 (Next.js Frontend Dockerization and Docker-compose Integration) and Story 2.3 (User Login Frontend). Ensure the frontend application is set up and the user can log in before starting this story.
*   Implement a clear and secure multi-step confirmation process to prevent accidental account deletion.
*   Ensure that upon successful deletion, the user is properly logged out from the frontend and redirected to an appropriate page (e.g., home or login).
*   Refer to the backend API documentation for the specific endpoint and expected response for account deletion.

### Environment Variables
*   `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`: The base URL for the backend API (e.g., `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`).

### UI/UX Specifications (from ui-spec.md)

#### Delete Account Flow
-   **Start:** Logged-in user navigates to `/dashboard/settings/delete-account`.
-   **Frontend:** Displays warning about account deletion and confirmation prompt.
-   **Action:** User confirms intention to delete (e.g., re-enters password).
-   **Action:** User submits deletion request.
-   **System:** Frontend sends DELETE request to `/api/v1/users/me`.
-   **System:** Backend marks account for deletion, returns success/error.
-   **Frontend:** Displays success message or error.
-   **End:** User automatically logged out and redirected to home/login page.

#### Visual Design and Branding
-   **Material Design:** Adhere to Material-UI guidelines for components, spacing, and overall visual language.
-   **Clean and Modern:** Emphasize a clean, modern aesthetic with clear hierarchy and intuitive layouts.
-   **Accessibility:** Ensure color contrasts, font sizes, and interactive elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

#### Accessibility and Usability
-   **WCAG 2.1 AA:** All frontend development and design must adhere to Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 Level AA.
-   **Semantic HTML:** Use appropriate HTML5 semantic elements to convey meaning and structure.
-   **Keyboard Navigation:** Ensure all interactive elements are navigable and operable via keyboard.
-   **Focus Management:** Provide clear visual focus indicators for interactive elements.
-   **ARIA Attributes:** Use ARIA (Accessible Rich Applications) attributes where semantic HTML is insufficient.
-   **Color Contrast:** Maintain sufficient color contrast ratios for text and interactive elements.
-   **Alternative Text:** Provide descriptive `alt` text for all meaningful images.
-   **Form Labels:** Ensure all form fields have associated, descriptive labels.
-   **Error Identification:** Clearly communicate form validation errors and provide guidance for correction.

#### Performance Optimization
-   **Code Splitting:** Leverage Next.js's automatic code splitting to load only the necessary code for each page.
-   **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js Image component for automatic image optimization (lazy loading, responsive images, modern formats).
-   **Lazy Loading:** Lazy load components, routes, and resources that are not immediately needed.
-   **Caching:** Implement effective caching strategies for API responses and static assets.
-   **Bundle Size Reduction:** Minimize JavaScript, CSS, and other asset sizes through tree-shaking, minification, and compression.
-   **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Static Site Generation (SSG):** Utilize Next.js's rendering strategies to deliver pre-rendered content for faster initial loads.

#### Error Handling and Feedback
-   **Client-Side Validation:** Implement robust client-side form validation to prevent invalid data from being submitted.
-   **API Error Handling:** Use RTK Query's error handling capabilities (e.g., `onQueryStarted` or custom `baseQuery`) to catch and process API errors globally.
-   **User Feedback Mechanisms:** Toast Notifications for transient messages, Alerts/Banners for critical messages, Inline Error Messages for form validation, Loading Indicators for async operations, Empty States for no content.

#### Security Considerations
-   **Authentication & Authorization:** Securely store and transmit JWTs (e.g., HTTP-only cookies for server-side rendering, or local storage with appropriate precautions). Implement robust client-side and server-side checks for protected routes.
-   **Input Validation & Sanitization:** Implement comprehensive client-side form validation and properly encode all user-generated content before rendering to prevent XSS attacks.
-   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:** Implement a strict Content Security Policy (CSP) and use sanitization libraries.
-   **Sensitive Data Handling:** Never store API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive secrets directly in client-side code.

### Testing

- Test file location: `nextjs-frontend/tests/unit/` for unit tests, `nextjs-frontend/tests/integration/` for integration tests.
