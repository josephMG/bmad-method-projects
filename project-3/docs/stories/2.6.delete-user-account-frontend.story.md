# User Story: Delete User Account Frontend

## 1. Title

As a logged-in user, I want to delete my account through the Next.js frontend, so that I can remove my personal data from the system.

## 2. Description

This story focuses on implementing the functionality for logged-in users to delete their account within the Next.js frontend. It will involve providing a clear and secure mechanism for account deletion, typically involving a confirmation step to prevent accidental deletion. The frontend will make an API call to the `@user-management-service` backend's delete user endpoint and handle the response, including logging the user out upon successful deletion. The UI will be built using Material-UI components.

## 3. Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements:

*   **Account Deletion Option Display:**
    *   Given I am logged in,
    *   When I navigate to the account settings or profile management section,
    *   Then I should see a clearly labeled option to delete my account.
*   **Deletion Confirmation:**
    *   Given I have initiated the account deletion process,
    *   When I am presented with a confirmation dialog or page,
    *   Then I must explicitly confirm my intention to delete the account (e.g., by re-entering password, typing a confirmation phrase).
*   **Successful Account Deletion:**
    *   Given I have confirmed my account deletion,
    *   When the frontend sends a DELETE request to the `@user-management-service` delete user API endpoint,
    *   Then upon successful deletion, a success message should be displayed.
    *   And I should be automatically logged out and redirected to the home or login page.
*   **Error Handling:**
    *   Given I am attempting to delete my account,
    *   When the backend API returns an error (e.g., server error, unauthorized),
    *   Then the frontend should display a clear and user-friendly error message.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

*   **UI/UX:** The account deletion process should be clear, with appropriate warnings and confirmation steps, consistent with Material-UI guidelines.
*   **Performance:** The deletion process and API call should be responsive.
*   **Security:** The account deletion process should be secure, preventing unauthorized or accidental deletions.
*   **Testability:** The account deletion component and its API integration should be testable using TDD principles.

## Dev Notes

### Important Considerations:
*   This story is dependent on the successful completion of Story 2.1 (Next.js Frontend Dockerization and Docker-compose Integration) and Story 2.3 (User Login Frontend). Ensure the frontend application is set up and the user can log in before starting this story.
*   Implement a clear and secure multi-step confirmation process to prevent accidental account deletion.
*   Ensure that upon successful deletion, the user is properly logged out from the frontend and redirected to an appropriate page (e.g., home or login).
*   Refer to the backend API documentation for the specific endpoint and expected response for account deletion.

## 4. Technical Details

*   **Frontend Component:** A dedicated React component for handling account deletion.
*   **State Management:** Redux Toolkit with RTK Query for API interaction.
*   **HTTP Client:** Axios for making the DELETE request to the backend.
*   **UI Library:** Material-UI components for dialogs, buttons, and confirmation elements.
*   **API Endpoint:** `@user-management-service` delete user endpoint (e.g., `/api/v1/users/{user_id}`).
*   **Testing:** Unit tests for component logic and integration tests for API interaction.

## 5. Dependencies

*   The `@user-management-service` backend delete user API must be functional and accessible.
*   User Login functionality must be implemented and working to provide authentication.

## 6. Estimation

*   **Size:** Small to Medium
*   **Effort:** [To be estimated by the development team]

## 7. Definition of Done

*   All acceptance criteria are met.
*   Code is reviewed and approved.
*   All automated tests pass.
*   The account deletion functionality is fully integrated into the Next.js application.
*   UI/UX is validated and approved.
*   Documentation for the account deletion component is updated.
