# Story 2.7: Dark Mode Toggle

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to be able to toggle between dark and light mode,
**so that** I can customize my viewing experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The user can find a theme toggle switch within the user's profile settings page.
2. The toggle clearly indicates the currently active theme (e.g., an icon or text label).
3. The user's selected theme (light or dark) is saved and automatically applied on subsequent visits to the application. If no explicit choice has been made, the application defaults to the user's system preference.
4. All Material-UI components used in the application adapt their styling correctly when the theme is switched.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **AC: 1 (Toggle Visibility)**
  - [x] Create `src/components/common/ThemeToggleButton/ThemeToggleButton.tsx` component using Material-UI `Switch` or `IconButton`.
  - [x] Add `src/components/common/ThemeToggleButton/index.ts` for barrel export.
  - [x] Integrate `ThemeToggleButton` into `src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx`.
  - [x] Integrate `ThemeToggleButton` into `src/app/login/page.tsx`.
- [x] **AC: 2 (Toggle Functionality)**

  - [x] Connect `ThemeToggleButton` to Redux theme state to dispatch theme change actions.
- [x] **AC: 3 (Theme Persistence)**
  - [x] Create `src/store/theme/themeSlice.ts` to manage theme state (e.g., `mode: 'light' | 'dark'`).
  - [x] Implement Redux reducers to toggle and set the theme.
  - [x] Modify `themeSlice.ts` to read initial theme from `localStorage` or system preference (`window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')`).
  - [x] Update `localStorage` whenever the theme changes.
  - [x] Integrate `themeSlice` into `src/store/index.ts`.
- [x] **AC: 4 (Styling Integration - Material-UI first)**

  - [x] Define light and dark palettes for Material-UI within the `ThemeProvider` configuration.
  - [x] Ensure Material-UI components adapt their styles based on the active theme.
- [x] **Global Styling (Tailwind CSS Integration)**
  - [x] Modify `src/app/globals.css` to define CSS variables for light and dark themes.
  - [x] Dynamically apply a `dark` class to the `html` or `body` element in `src/app/layout.tsx` based on the Redux theme state.
  - [x] Ensure existing Tailwind CSS classes respond correctly to the `dark` class for theme switching.
- [x] **Testing**
  - [x] Write unit tests for `src/store/theme/themeSlice.ts` covering initial state, reducers, and `localStorage` interactions.
  - [x] Write unit tests for `src/components/common/ThemeToggleButton/ThemeToggleButton.tsx` covering rendering, click events, and visual feedback.
  - [x] Write integration tests to verify theme switching functionality across different parts of the application, ensuring Material-UI and Tailwind styles are applied correctly.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

No direct insights from previous stories are relevant to theme toggling.

### Data Models

The user's theme preference will be stored client-side using `localStorage`. No backend data model changes are required for this story.

### API Specifications

No new API endpoints are required for this story. Theme preference will be managed client-side.

### Component Specifications

- A new reusable `ThemeToggleButton` component will be created. It should be placed in `src/components/common/ThemeToggleButton/`.
- This component will utilize Material-UI components (e.g., `Switch` or `IconButton`) for its visual representation.
- The component should clearly indicate the currently active theme.

### File Locations

- `src/components/common/ThemeToggleButton/ThemeToggleButton.tsx` (for the component logic and UI).
- `src/components/common/ThemeToggleButton/index.ts` (for barrel export).
- `src/store/theme/themeSlice.ts` (for Redux Toolkit slice to manage theme state).
- `src/store/index.ts` (to integrate the new theme slice into the root reducer).
- `src/app/dashboard/settings/page.tsx` (to integrate the `ThemeToggleButton`).
- `src/app/layout.tsx` (to wrap the application with Material-UI `ThemeProvider` and handle global theme class).
- `src/app/globals.css` (for defining CSS variables for themes and integrating with Tailwind CSS).

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for the `themeSlice` (e.g., initial state, reducers for toggling and setting theme, `localStorage` interaction).
- Unit tests for the `ThemeToggleButton` component (e.g., rendering, click events, visual feedback of active theme).
- Integration tests to verify that theme changes are correctly applied across different Material-UI and Tailwind-styled components within the application.
- All tests should adhere to the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern and be placed in `tests/unit/` or `tests/integration/` within the `nextjs-frontend` directory. The primary testing framework to be used is Vitest. [Source: architecture/test-strategy-and-standards.md]

### Accessibility Guidelines

- **Color Contrast:** Ensure sufficient color contrast ratios for text and interactive elements in both light and dark themes, adhering to WCAG 2.1 AA standards. [Source: ui-architecture/styling-guidelines.md]
- **Keyboard Navigation:** The theme toggle must be fully navigable and operable via keyboard. [Source: ui-architecture/authentication-components.md]
- **ARIA Attributes:** Use appropriate ARIA attributes for the theme toggle to ensure screen reader compatibility. [Source: ui-architecture/authentication-components.md]

### Material-UI and Tailwind CSS Theme Integration Best Practices

- **Prioritize Material-UI Theming:** For Material-UI components, leverage the `ThemeProvider` and its `palette` configuration for consistent theming. Avoid overriding Material-UI component styles directly with Tailwind CSS where Material-UI's theming system is sufficient.
- **Global Styles with Tailwind:** Use Tailwind CSS for global utility classes and for styling custom components that are not part of Material-UI. Ensure that Tailwind's `dark:` variant is correctly configured and applied to the `html` or `body` element based on the Redux theme state.
- **Avoid Conflicts:** Be mindful of potential style conflicts when combining Material-UI's JSS/Emotion-based styling with Tailwind CSS. Use `!important` sparingly and only when absolutely necessary to resolve conflicts, preferring to adjust the theme configuration or component structure instead.
- **Documentation:** Document any specific strategies or decisions made regarding the interaction between Material-UI and Tailwind CSS styling within the component files or a dedicated styling guide if complexity arises.

### Technical Constraints

- **Styling Guidelines Reference:** The primary styling guidelines are located at `ui-architecture/styling-guidelines.md`. The `architecture/styling-guidelines.md` document does not exist and should not be referenced.
- **UI Library:** Material-UI (latest stable version) will be used for core UI components. Developers should refer to the official Material-UI documentation for specific component usage and customization. [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md, ui-architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS will be used for utility-first styling. Global theme variables should be defined in `src/app/globals.css` and integrated with Tailwind's theme extension. Dark mode support should leverage `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` for initial system preference detection. [Source: ui-architecture/styling-guidelines.md, ui-architecture/frontend-tech-stack.md]
- **State Management:** Redux Toolkit will be used to manage the global theme state. The theme preference should be persisted using `localStorage`. [Source: ui-architecture/state-management.md]
- **Theme Application:** The Material-UI `ThemeProvider` should be used to apply the selected theme to Material-UI components. For Tailwind CSS, a `dark` class should be dynamically applied to the `html` or `body` element.
- **System Preference:** The application should initially detect and apply the user's system-wide dark/light mode preference.

### Quality Gate Decision

**Decision:** PASS
**Rationale:** All acceptance criteria and tasks have been met and verified. The implementation aligns with UI/UX and UI Architecture documents.

### Detailed Review

#### 1. Requirements Traceability (Given-When-Then patterns):

- **AC 1: Toggle Visibility**
  - **Given** a user is on the profile settings page,
  - **When** they look for a theme toggle switch,
  - **Then** they should find it clearly visible.
  - **Test Case Idea:** Verified the presence and location of the toggle switch on the settings page through code review and passing integration tests.

- **AC 2: Toggle Functionality**
  - **Given** a user is on the profile settings page and the toggle indicates the current theme,
  - **When** they interact with the toggle,
  - **Then** the toggle should visually update to reflect the new theme.
  - **Test Case Idea:** Verified through unit and integration tests that clicking the toggle updates the theme and its visual representation.

- **AC 3: Theme Persistence**
  - **Given** a user has selected a theme (light/dark) and it's saved,
  - **When** they revisit the application,
  - **Then** the previously selected theme should be automatically applied.
  - **Given** a user has not explicitly chosen a theme,
  - **When** they visit the application,
  - **Then** the application should default to their system preference.
  - **Test Case Idea:** Verified through unit tests for `themeSlice` that `localStorage` is used for persistence and system preference is respected.

- **AC 4: Styling Integration (Material-UI & Tailwind CSS)**
  - **Given** a user switches the theme,
  - **When** Material-UI components are rendered,
  - **Then** they should adapt their styling correctly to the new theme.
  - **Given** a user switches the theme,
  - **When** Tailwind CSS styled elements are rendered,
  - **Then** they should adapt their styling correctly to the new theme.
  - **Test Case Idea:** Verified through integration tests and code review of `ThemeProvider.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, and `globals.css` that both Material-UI and Tailwind styles adapt correctly.

#### 2. Risk-Based Testing:

- **Probability x Impact Assessment:**
  - **High Impact, Medium Probability:** Theme persistence (AC3) - Implemented and verified with unit tests.
  - **Medium Impact, High Probability:** Styling integration (AC4) - Implemented and verified with integration tests and code review.
