# Story 2.9: Frontend Routing and Navigation

**As a** user
**I want to** navigate seamlessly between login, registration, and dashboard-related pages
**So that** I can access different functionalities of the application.

## Status

- **Current Status:** Completed
- **Priority:** Medium
- **Sprint:** [To be assigned]

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  Users can navigate between the Login and Register pages using provided links.
2.  Upon successful login, users are redirected to a dedicated Dashboard index page.
3.  From the Dashboard index page, users can navigate to the Profile, Change Password, and Delete Account pages via dedicated links.

## Tasks / Subtasks

1.  [x] **Implement Navigation Links (AC: 1, 3):**
    *   Add `Link` components to `src/app/login/page.tsx` and `src/app/register/page.tsx` for mutual navigation.
    *   Add `Link` components to `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` to navigate to `src/app/dashboard/settings/profile/page.tsx`, `src/app/dashboard/settings/change-password/page.tsx`, and `src/app/dashboard/settings/delete-account/page.tsx`.
2.  [x] **Create Dashboard Index Page (AC: 2):**
    *   Create `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` with a basic layout and navigation links.
3.  [x] **Verify Routing (AC: 1, 2, 3):**
    *   Write integration tests to verify navigation between login/register pages.
    *   Write integration tests to verify successful login redirects to the dashboard.
    *   Write integration tests to verify navigation from the dashboard to profile, change-password, and delete-account pages.

## Dev Notes

### Architectural Context

This story focuses on implementing frontend routing and navigation using Next.js App Router and Material-UI components.

### Technical Details

-   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js (latest version) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   **Routing:** Next.js App Router. Route segments are kebab-case. Pages are `page.tsx`. [Source: ui-architecture/routing.md, ui-architecture/component-standards.md]
-   **UI Library:** Material-UI (latest version) [Source: architecture/tech-stack.md]
-   **Link Integration:** Next.js `Link` component should be integrated with Material-UI `Link` component. Refer to the Stack Overflow article: `https://stackoverflow.com/questions/66226576/using-the-material-ui-link-component-with-the-next-js-link-component/74419666#74419666` for proper integration. This ensures correct navigation and styling.
-   **Project Structure:**
    *   `src/app/`: Next.js App Router for pages.
    *   `src/components/`: Reusable UI components.
    *   `src/app/login/page.tsx`: Login page.
    *   `src/app/register/page.tsx`: Registration page.
    *   `src/app/dashboard/`: New dashboard route segment.
    *   `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`: New dashboard index page.
    *   `src/app/dashboard/settings/profile/page.tsx`: User profile page.
    *   `src/app/dashboard/settings/change-password/page.tsx`: Change password page.
    *   `src/app/dashboard/settings/delete-account/page.tsx`: Delete account page.
    [Source: ui-architecture/project-structure.md, ui-architecture/routing.md]
-   **Testing:** Unit and integration tests using Vitest, React Testing Library. Mock `useRouter` for testing redirects. [Source: ui-architecture/testing-requirements.md]

### Coding Standards

-   Adhere to existing TypeScript and React coding standards within the `@nextjs-frontend` project. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md]
-   Use meaningful variable names and comments where necessary.

### Testing

-   **Frameworks:** Vitest, React Testing Library. [Source: ui-architecture/testing-requirements.md]
-   **Scope:** Integration tests for navigation between login/register, successful login redirection, and dashboard navigation.
-   **Test Data:** Mock data should accurately reflect expected routing behavior.
-   **Mocking:** Mock `useRouter` for testing navigation and redirection. [Source: ui-architecture/testing-requirements.md]

### Debug Log References

-   (To be filled by Dev Agent)

### Completion Notes List

-   Created `src/app/dashboard/page.tsx` with a basic layout and navigation links.
-   Implemented navigation links between login/register pages and from the dashboard to profile, change-password, and delete-account pages.
-   Verified routing functionality with integration tests.
-   Resolved `legacyBehavior` deprecation warning by refactoring Material-UI Link with Next.js Link integration. All frontend tests pass.

### File List

-   `docs/stories/2.9.frontend-routing-and-navigation.story.md`
-   `nextjs-frontend/src/app/dashboard/page.tsx`
-   `nextjs-frontend/src/app/login/page.tsx`
-   `nextjs-frontend/src/app/register/page.tsx`
-   `nextjs-frontend/tests/integration/Routing.integration.test.tsx`

## QA Results

-   **Status:** PASS
-   **Date:** 2025-10-02
-   **Tester:** Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)
-   **Findings:** All frontend integration tests for routing and navigation passed successfully. The implementation correctly handles navigation between login/register pages, redirection to the dashboard upon successful login, and navigation from the dashboard to profile, change-password, and delete-account pages. The integration of Next.js Link with Material-UI Link components is correctly implemented.
-   **Conclusion:** The frontend routing and navigation functionality is confirmed and meets the acceptance criteria.
