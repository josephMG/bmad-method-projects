# Story 3.1: Implement End-to-End (E2E) Testing

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** development team,
**We want** to implement End-to-End (E2E) testing for critical user flows,
**so that** we can ensure the entire application (frontend, backend, and database) functions correctly together and provides a seamless user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A suitable E2E testing framework (e.g., Playwright) shall be integrated into the `nextjs-frontend` project.
2.  A basic E2E test shall be created for the user registration flow, covering frontend interaction, API request/response, and backend data persistence.
3.  A basic E2E test shall be created for the user login flow, covering frontend interaction, API request/response, and successful authentication.
4.  E2E tests shall be runnable locally via `docker-compose`.
5.  E2E tests shall be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions) to run on relevant pull requests.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Research and Select E2E Framework**
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Evaluate Playwright vs. Cypress based on project needs (e.g., full-stack capabilities, browser support, ease of integration).
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Document the chosen framework and rationale in `docs/ui-architecture/testing-requirements.md`.
- [ ] **Task 2: Setup E2E Testing Environment**
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Install the chosen E2E framework and its dependencies in `nextjs-frontend`.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Configure the E2E framework to run against the `docker-compose` setup (frontend and backend services).
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Create necessary test utilities and helper functions (e.g., for test data setup/teardown, authentication).
- [ ] **Task 3: Implement User Registration E2E Test**
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Write an E2E test script that simulates a new user registering through the frontend UI.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Verify that the registration API call is successful and the user is created in the backend database.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Assert that the frontend displays appropriate success messages and redirects.
- [ ] **Task 4: Implement User Login E2E Test**
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Write an E2E test script that simulates a registered user logging in through the frontend UI.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Verify that the login API call is successful and a JWT is received.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Assert that the frontend displays appropriate success messages and redirects to the dashboard.
- [ ] **Task 5: Integrate E2E Tests into CI/CD**
  - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Modify `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to include a step for running E2E tests.
  - [ ] Subtask 5.2: Ensure the CI environment can correctly set up and run the E2E tests against the deployed services.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story builds upon the foundational frontend and backend implementations, particularly the user registration and login flows (Stories 1.1, 2.2, 2.3).

### Data Models
E2E tests will interact with the `User` data model indirectly through the API. No direct data model changes are expected.

### API Specifications
E2E tests will utilize the existing `/register` and `/token` API endpoints, as well as any other relevant user management endpoints.

### Component Specifications
E2E tests will interact with the `RegistrationForm` and `LoginForm` components, among others.

### File Locations
- `nextjs-frontend/e2e/` (new directory for E2E test files)
- `nextjs-frontend/package.json` (for E2E framework dependencies)
- `docker-compose.yml` (potentially for E2E test service or configuration)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (for CI/CD integration)
- `docs/ui-architecture/testing-requirements.md` (to update with E2E framework details)

### Testing
- **Frameworks:** Playwright is a strong candidate due to its full-stack capabilities and robust browser automation. Cypress is another option, particularly for frontend-focused E2E.
- **Test Data Management:** Consider using factories or dedicated test data generation scripts to ensure consistent and isolated test data for E2E scenarios.
- **Environment:** Tests must run against a fully integrated environment (frontend, backend, database) typically spun up via `docker-compose`.

### Technical Constraints
- **Docker:** E2E tests must be runnable within a Dockerized environment.
- **CI/CD:** Integration with GitHub Actions is required.
