# Story 3.10: Implement Frontend Error Logging and Monitoring

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** development and UX team,
**We want** to implement a comprehensive error logging and monitoring setup for the frontend application,
**so that** we can quickly identify, diagnose, and resolve user-facing issues, improving the overall user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A suitable frontend error monitoring solution (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket, custom solution) shall be selected and integrated into the `nextjs-frontend`.
2.  All unhandled JavaScript errors and promise rejections in the frontend shall be automatically captured and reported to the monitoring solution.
3.  Key user interactions and context (e.g., user ID, route, component state) shall be included in error reports where relevant and secure.
4.  Performance metrics related to frontend errors (e.g., error rate, impact on user experience) shall be trackable.
5.  Alerts shall be configured for critical frontend errors or spikes in error rates.
6.  A process for reviewing and acting on frontend error reports shall be defined.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Research and Select Frontend Error Monitoring Solution**
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Evaluate different frontend error monitoring solutions based on features, cost, ease of integration with Next.js, and compatibility with our existing observability goals.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Document the chosen solution and rationale in `docs/ui-architecture/error-handling-feedback.md` (update existing section or create new).
- [ ] **Task 2: Integrate Monitoring Solution**
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Install the chosen monitoring solution's SDK into `nextjs-frontend`.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Configure the SDK to capture unhandled errors and promise rejections.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Ensure sensitive user data is not inadvertently captured or logged.
- [ ] **Task 3: Enhance Error Context**
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Implement mechanisms to attach relevant user context (e.g., authenticated user ID, session ID) to error reports.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Add breadcrumbs or transaction tracing for critical user flows to provide more context for errors.
- [ ] **Task 4: Configure Alerts and Dashboards**
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Set up alerts for high-priority errors or significant increases in error rates.
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Create dashboards within the monitoring solution to visualize frontend error trends and impact.
- [ ] **Task 5: Define Error Review Process**
  - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Establish a process for the development and UX teams to regularly review frontend error reports and prioritize fixes.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story will complement the backend observability efforts (Story 3.2) by providing a complete picture of application health from the user's perspective.

### Data Models
No direct data model changes are expected.

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints are expected.

### Component Specifications
New libraries or SDKs will be integrated into the frontend.

### File Locations
- `nextjs-frontend/` (modifications for SDK integration)
- `docs/ui-architecture/error-handling-feedback.md` (update existing section or create new for monitoring details)

### Testing
- The implementation will be verified by intentionally introducing errors and confirming they are correctly logged and reported.

### Technical Constraints
- The solution should be performant and not negatively impact frontend load times or user experience.
- Compliance with data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) for captured user data.
