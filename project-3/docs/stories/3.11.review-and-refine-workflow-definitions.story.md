# Story 3.11: Review and Refine Workflow Definitions

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** BMad team,
**We want** to regularly review and update our workflow definitions in `.bmad-core/workflows/`,
**so that** our agile processes remain efficient, adaptable, and aligned with lessons learned from completed epics and evolving project needs.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A schedule for recurring workflow review and refinement sessions shall be established (e.g., bi-monthly, quarterly).
2.  At least one workflow definition (e.g., `brownfield-fullstack.yaml`) shall be reviewed and updated based on recent project experiences or new insights.
3.  The updated workflow definition shall be documented with a clear change log.
4.  The review process shall identify opportunities to streamline workflows, improve agent coordination, or incorporate new best practices.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Establish Review Schedule**
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Determine the optimal frequency for workflow review sessions.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Schedule the first review session with relevant agents (e.g., Bob (SM), BMad Orchestrator, and other agents as needed).
- [ ] **Task 2: Select Workflow for Review**
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Choose a workflow definition from `.bmad-core/workflows/` for the initial review, prioritizing based on recent usage or identified areas for improvement.
- [ ] **Task 3: Conduct Workflow Review Session**
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Facilitate a session to discuss the selected workflow, gathering feedback on its effectiveness, pain points, and potential enhancements.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Identify specific areas within the workflow that can be streamlined, clarified, or updated.
- [ ] **Task 4: Refine Workflow Definition**
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Based on the review, update the selected workflow definition file (e.g., `brownfield-fullstack.yaml`) to incorporate improvements.
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Ensure the change log within the workflow definition is updated.
- [ ] **Task 5: Document Lessons Learned**
  - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Document key lessons learned from the review and refinement process, potentially in a new section of `docs/architecture/core-workflows.md` or a dedicated `docs/process/workflow-lessons-learned.md`.
