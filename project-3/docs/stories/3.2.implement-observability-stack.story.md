# Story 3.2: Implement Observability Stack

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** development and operations team,
**We want** to implement a comprehensive observability stack for our application,
**so that** we can monitor performance, identify issues proactively, and ensure application health and security.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A suitable observability stack (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, ELK stack, cloud-native solutions) shall be selected and documented.
2.  Key performance metrics (e.g., response times, error rates, resource utilization) shall be collected from both the `user-management-service` backend and the `nextjs-frontend`.
3.  Application health checks and alerts shall be configured for critical services.
4.  Structured logging shall be implemented across both backend and frontend, with logs centralized and searchable.
5.  Basic dashboards shall be created to visualize key metrics and application health.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Research and Select Observability Stack**
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Evaluate different observability solutions (e.g., Prometheus/Grafana, ELK stack, AWS CloudWatch/X-Ray) based on project needs, existing infrastructure, and cost.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Document the chosen stack and rationale in `docs/architecture/monitoring-and-logging.md` (new document).
- [ ] **Task 2: Implement Backend Metrics Collection**
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Integrate a metrics library (e.g., `Prometheus client` for Python) into `user-management-service`.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Expose standard metrics (e.g., request duration, error counts, CPU/memory usage) from the FastAPI application.
- [ ] **Task 3: Implement Frontend Metrics Collection**
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Integrate a frontend performance monitoring tool (e.g., Web Vitals, custom metrics) into `nextjs-frontend`.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Collect key frontend performance metrics (e.g., FCP, LCP, INP) and user interaction data.
- [ ] **Task 4: Centralize Logging**
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Configure `user-management-service` to output structured (JSON) logs to a centralized logging system.
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Implement structured logging for `nextjs-frontend` and send logs to the centralized system.
  - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Ensure correlation IDs are propagated and used in logs across services.
- [ ] **Task 5: Configure Alerting**
  - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Define critical alerts based on error rates, service unavailability, and performance thresholds.
  - [ ] Subtask 5.2: Configure the observability stack to trigger alerts (e.g., Slack, email) when thresholds are breached.
- [ ] **Task 6: Create Dashboards**
  - [ ] Subtask 6.1: Design and implement basic dashboards to visualize backend and frontend metrics, logs, and alerts.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story builds upon the existing backend and frontend services, ensuring we have visibility into their operation.

### Data Models
No direct data model changes are expected. Observability focuses on operational data.

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints are expected. Existing API endpoints will be instrumented for metrics and logging.

### Component Specifications
New components or libraries will be integrated into both backend and frontend for metrics collection and logging.

### File Locations
- `user-management-service/` (modifications for metrics and logging)
- `nextjs-frontend/` (modifications for metrics and logging)
- `docs/architecture/monitoring-and-logging.md` (new document for observability stack details)
- `docker-compose.yml` (potentially for observability stack services)

### Testing
- Observability implementation will be verified through manual checks of dashboards and alerts, and potentially integration tests for metrics exposure.

### Technical Constraints
- **Docker:** Observability components should ideally be containerized and integrated with `docker-compose` for local development.
- **Cloud Provider:** The chosen stack should be compatible with our target cloud provider (AWS).
