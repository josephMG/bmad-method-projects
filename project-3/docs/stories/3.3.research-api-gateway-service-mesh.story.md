# Story 3.3: Research API Gateway/Service Mesh Integration

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As an** architect,
**I want** to research and evaluate API Gateway and Service Mesh solutions,
**so that** we can determine the best approach for centralized traffic management, security policies, and enhanced observability for our microservices.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A comprehensive research report shall be produced, comparing at least three leading API Gateway solutions (e.g., AWS API Gateway, Kong, Apigee) and three leading Service Mesh solutions (e.g., Istio, Linkerd, Consul Connect).
2.  The report shall evaluate each solution based on criteria such as features (traffic management, security, observability), integration complexity, operational overhead, cost, and compatibility with our existing tech stack (FastAPI, Next.js, AWS).
3.  The report shall include a recommendation for either an API Gateway, a Service Mesh, or a combination of both, with a clear rationale.
4.  The report shall identify potential benefits and drawbacks of the recommended solution(s) for our project.
5.  The report shall outline a high-level plan for integrating the recommended solution(s).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Define Evaluation Criteria**
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: List key features and non-functional requirements (NFRs) that an API Gateway/Service Mesh should address for our project.
- [ ] **Task 2: Research Leading Solutions**
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Identify and gather information on at least three prominent API Gateway solutions.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Identify and gather information on at least three prominent Service Mesh solutions.
- [ ] **Task 3: Comparative Analysis**
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Create a comparison matrix or detailed analysis for each evaluated solution against the defined criteria.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Analyze the compatibility of each solution with our current and planned AWS infrastructure.
- [ ] **Task 4: Formulate Recommendation**
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Based on the comparative analysis, recommend the most suitable solution(s) (API Gateway, Service Mesh, or hybrid).
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Justify the recommendation with a clear rationale, highlighting benefits and addressing potential drawbacks.
- [ ] **Task 5: Outline Integration Plan**
  - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Develop a high-level plan for integrating the recommended solution(s) into our existing architecture.
  - [ ] Subtask 5.2: Identify potential architectural changes or new components required for integration.
- [ ] **Task 6: Document Findings**
  - [ ] Subtask 6.1: Compile all research, analysis, recommendation, and integration plan into a comprehensive report, saved as `docs/architecture/api-gateway-service-mesh-research.md` (new document).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This research will inform future architectural decisions and potentially impact how our microservices communicate and are secured.

### Data Models
No direct data model changes are expected.

### API Specifications
This research will directly influence how our API endpoints are exposed and managed.

### Component Specifications
This research may lead to the introduction of new infrastructure components.

### File Locations
- `docs/architecture/api-gateway-service-mesh-research.md` (new document for the research report)

### Testing
- The outcome of this research will inform how future testing strategies, particularly for integration and E2E tests, might need to adapt.

### Technical Constraints
- **AWS:** Preference for solutions that integrate well with AWS services.
- **Microservices:** Solutions must be suitable for a microservice architecture.
