# Story 3.4: Define Security Penetration Testing Strategy

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** security-conscious team,
**We want** to define a comprehensive strategy for regular security penetration testing,
**so that** we can proactively identify vulnerabilities through simulated attacks and enhance the overall security posture of our application.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A documented strategy for security penetration testing shall be created, outlining its scope, frequency, and methodology.
2.  Recommended tools and services for conducting penetration tests shall be identified and evaluated.
3.  A process for managing and remediating identified vulnerabilities shall be defined.
4.  The strategy shall include guidelines for integrating penetration testing results into our development lifecycle.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Define Penetration Testing Scope**
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Identify critical application areas and data that require focused penetration testing.
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Determine the types of attacks to simulate (e.g., OWASP Top 10, business logic flaws).
- [ ] **Task 2: Research Tools and Services**
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Evaluate open-source and commercial penetration testing tools (e.g., Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nessus).
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Research third-party penetration testing services and their offerings.
- [ ] **Task 3: Develop Remediation Process**
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Define a clear workflow for reporting, prioritizing, and tracking the remediation of identified vulnerabilities.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Establish communication channels for security findings with development teams.
- [ ] **Task 4: Integrate into SDLC**
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Outline how penetration testing will fit into our existing Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), including scheduling and responsibilities.
- [ ] **Task 5: Document Strategy**
  - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Compile the penetration testing strategy into a formal document, saved as `docs/security/penetration-testing-strategy.md` (new document).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story complements our existing security measures (SAST, input validation) by adding a dynamic testing component.

### Data Models
No direct data model changes are expected.

### API Specifications
Penetration testing will target our API endpoints.

### Component Specifications
No new components are expected, but existing components will be subject to testing.

### File Locations
- `docs/security/penetration-testing-strategy.md` (new document for the strategy)

### Testing
- This story is about defining a testing strategy itself, rather than implementing tests.

### Technical Constraints
- The strategy should be practical and align with our team's resources and expertise.
