# Story 3.6: Define Project-Specific Design System

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** UI/UX team,
**We want** to define the scope and initial components of a project-specific design system,
**so that** we can ensure greater consistency, reusability, and efficiency for future UI development beyond Material-UI guidelines.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A document outlining the core principles and philosophy of our project's design system shall be created.
2.  Initial design tokens (e.g., colors, typography, spacing) shall be defined and documented.
3.  At least three foundational UI components (e.g., Button, Input, Card) shall be designed and documented within the design system, including their states and usage guidelines.
4.  A plan for integrating the design system into the `nextjs-frontend` development workflow shall be outlined.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Define Design System Principles**
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Articulate the core values and goals of our design system (e.g., consistency, accessibility, brand identity).
- [ ] **Task 2: Define Initial Design Tokens**
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Establish a project-specific color palette, including semantic colors.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Define typographic scales (font families, sizes, weights, line heights).
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Standardize spacing units and breakpoints.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.4: Document these design tokens in `docs/ui-ux/design-system-tokens.md` (new document).
- [ ] **Task 3: Design Foundational Components**
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Select 3-5 foundational UI components (e.g., Button, Input, Card) that are frequently used.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Design these components, considering their various states (e.g., hover, active, disabled) and responsiveness.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.3: Document usage guidelines, accessibility considerations, and code examples for each component in `docs/ui-ux/design-system-components.md` (new document).
- [ ] **Task 4: Plan Integration with Frontend**
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Outline how the design system will be implemented and consumed by the `nextjs-frontend` (e.g., using CSS-in-JS, Tailwind plugins, Material-UI customization).
- [ ] **Task 5: Document Design System Overview**
  - [ ] Subtask 5.1: Create an overview document for the design system, saved as `docs/ui-ux/design-system-overview.md` (new document).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story will build upon the existing Material-UI integration and styling guidelines, providing a more tailored approach.

### Data Models
No direct data model changes are expected.

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints are expected.

### Component Specifications
This story will define new UI components and their specifications.

### File Locations
- `docs/ui-ux/design-system-overview.md` (new document)
- `docs/ui-ux/design-system-tokens.md` (new document)
- `docs/ui-ux/design-system-components.md` (new document)

### Testing
- The design system will provide guidelines for consistent UI testing.

### Technical Constraints
- The design system should be compatible with Material-UI and Tailwind CSS, leveraging their capabilities where possible.
