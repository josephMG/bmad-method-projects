# Story 3.7: Conduct Formal Competitive Analysis

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** product and business team,
**We want** to conduct a formal competitive analysis of other user management systems,
**so that** we can identify unique selling points, market gaps, and potential feature inspirations for our own system.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A list of at least 3-5 direct and indirect competitors in the user management system space shall be identified.
2.  A detailed competitive analysis report shall be produced, comparing our system against competitors on key criteria.
3.  The report shall identify unique selling points of our system and potential market gaps we can address.
4.  The report shall highlight features or approaches from competitors that could inspire improvements or additions to our roadmap.
5.  The report shall be saved as `docs/market-research/competitive-analysis-report.md` (new document).
