# Story 3.8: Facilitate Product Roadmap Planning

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** product leader,

3.  A high-level feature set for Phase 2 and the long-term shall be outlined, aligned with strategic goals.
4.  Estimated timelines and initial resource allocation considerations for the roadmap items shall be documented.
5.  The resulting product roadmap shall be documented and saved as `docs/prd/product-roadmap.md` (new document).
