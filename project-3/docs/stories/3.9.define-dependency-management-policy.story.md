# Story 3.9: Define Dependency Management Policy and Process

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** development and architecture team,
**We want** to define a clear policy and process for managing and updating project dependencies,
**so that** we can prevent technical debt, ensure security, and maintain application stability.

## Acceptance Criteria
1.  A documented dependency management policy shall be created, outlining guidelines for adding, updating, and removing dependencies.
2.  The policy shall define criteria for evaluating major version upgrades, including compatibility, security, and performance considerations.
3.  A process for regularly reviewing and updating dependencies shall be established, including responsibilities and frequency.
4.  Tools and automation (e.g., Dependabot, Renovate) for dependency monitoring and updates shall be integrated or recommended.
5.  The policy and process shall be documented and saved as `docs/development/dependency-management-policy.md` (new document).

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] **Task 1: Draft Dependency Policy Guidelines**
  - [ ] Subtask 1.1: Define rules for introducing new dependencies (e.g., licensing, security, maintenance status).
  - [ ] Subtask 1.2: Establish criteria for evaluating major version upgrades (e.g., breaking changes, migration effort, performance impact).
  - [ ] Subtask 1.3: Outline a strategy for handling deprecated or unmaintained dependencies.
- [ ] **Task 2: Define Update Process**
  - [ ] Subtask 2.1: Determine the frequency for dependency reviews (e.g., monthly, quarterly).
  - [ ] Subtask 2.2: Assign responsibilities for monitoring, evaluating, and performing updates.
  - [ ] Subtask 2.3: Define a workflow for testing and deploying dependency updates.
- [ ] **Task 3: Research and Integrate Automation Tools**
  - [ ] Subtask 3.1: Evaluate tools like Dependabot (already in use) and Renovate for automated dependency updates and vulnerability scanning.
  - [ ] Subtask 3.2: Configure selected tools to align with the defined policy and process.
- [ ] **Task 4: Document Policy and Process**
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Compile all guidelines, processes, and tool configurations into a formal document.
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Save the document as `docs/development/dependency-management-policy.md` (new document).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
This story is crucial for maintaining the health of our codebase as we continue to develop new features and integrate new technologies.

### Data Models
No direct data model changes are expected.

### API Specifications
No new API endpoints are expected.

### Component Specifications
No new components are expected.

### File Locations
- `docs/development/dependency-management-policy.md` (new document for the policy)

### Testing
- The policy will guide how dependency updates are tested to prevent regressions.

### Technical Constraints
- The policy should be practical and enforceable across both backend (Python) and frontend (Next.js) dependencies.
