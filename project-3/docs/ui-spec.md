- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP):** Time until the largest content element is visible.
- **Interaction to Next Paint (INP):** Responsiveness to user interactions.
- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS):** Visual stability of the page.
- **Total Blocking Time (TBT):** Responsiveness to user input.

**Optimization Strategies:**
- **Code Splitting:** Leverage Next.js's automatic code splitting to load only the necessary code for each page.
- **Image Optimization:** Use Next.js Image component for automatic image optimization (lazy loading, responsive images, modern formats).
- **Lazy Loading:** Lazy load components, routes, and resources that are not immediately needed.
- **Caching:** Implement effective caching strategies for API responses and static assets.
- **Bundle Size Reduction:** Minimize JavaScript, CSS, and other asset sizes through tree-shaking, minification, and compression.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR) / Static Site Generation (SSG):** Utilize Next.js's rendering strategies to deliver pre-rendered content for faster initial loads.
- **Critical CSS:** Extract and inline critical CSS for above-the-fold content.
- **Web Workers:** Offload heavy computations to web workers to keep the main thread free.
- **Font Optimization:** Optimize font loading to prevent layout shifts and improve text rendering.

**Assumptions:**
- Performance monitoring tools (e.g., Lighthouse, Web Vitals) will be used to track and measure performance.
- Performance budgets will be defined for key metrics.
- Developers will prioritize performance during implementation.

## Error Handling and Feedback

This section outlines the strategies for error handling and user feedback within the `nextjs-frontend` application, ensuring a robust and user-friendly experience even in the face of unexpected issues.

**Key Principles:**
- **Graceful Degradation:** The application should remain functional even when errors occur, providing a degraded but usable experience.
- **Clear Communication:** Error messages should be clear, concise, and actionable, guiding users on how to resolve the issue.
- **Contextual Feedback:** Feedback should be provided in context, near the element or action that triggered it.
- **Consistency:** Error handling and feedback patterns should be consistent across the application.

**Error Handling Strategies:**
- **Client-Side Validation:** Implement robust client-side form validation to prevent invalid data from being submitted.
- **API Error Handling:**
    - **Global Interceptors:** Use RTK Query's error handling capabilities (e.g., `onQueryStarted` or custom `baseQuery`) to catch and process API errors globally.
    - **Component-Level Handling:** Handle specific API errors within components to provide contextual feedback.
    - **Error Boundaries:** Use React Error Boundaries to catch JavaScript errors in component trees and display fallback UI.
- **User Feedback Mechanisms:**
    - **Toast Notifications:** For transient, non-blocking messages (success, info, warning).
    - **Alerts/Banners:** For more persistent or critical messages that require user attention.
    - **Inline Error Messages:** For form validation errors, displayed directly next to the input field.
    - **Loading Indicators:** Provide visual feedback during asynchronous operations (e.g., spinners, skeleton screens).
    - **Empty States:** Design clear empty states for lists or data displays when no content is available.

**Assumptions:**
- Backend API will return standardized error responses (e.g., HTTP status codes, error messages).
- A consistent UI component library (Material-UI) will be used for displaying feedback.
- Error logging will be implemented for tracking and debugging frontend errors.

## Security Considerations

This section details the security considerations for the `nextjs-frontend` application, focusing on protecting user data and preventing common frontend vulnerabilities.

**Key Principles:**
- **Defense in Depth:** Implement multiple layers of security controls.
- **Least Privilege:** Components and users should only have access to the resources they absolutely need.
- **Secure by Design:** Integrate security considerations from the initial design phase.
- **Regular Audits:** Conduct regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

**Security Measures:**
- **Authentication & Authorization:**
    - **JWT Handling:** Securely store and transmit JWTs (e.g., HTTP-only cookies for server-side rendering, or local storage with appropriate precautions).
    - **Protected Routes:** Implement robust client-side and server-side checks for protected routes.
    - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** If applicable, implement RBAC to restrict access to certain UI elements or functionalities based on user roles.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization:**
    - **Client-Side Validation:** Implement comprehensive client-side form validation to prevent invalid data from being submitted.
    - **Output Encoding:** Properly encode all user-generated content before rendering to prevent XSS attacks.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Prevention:**
    - **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implement a strict CSP to mitigate XSS and other code injection attacks.
    - **Sanitization Libraries:** Use libraries to sanitize user-generated HTML content.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Prevention:**
    - **CSRF Tokens:** Implement CSRF tokens for state-changing requests (if not handled by backend's JWT strategy).
- **Sensitive Data Handling:**
    - **No Client-Side Secrets:** Never store API keys, database credentials, or other sensitive secrets directly in client-side code.
    - **Secure Storage:** Use secure storage mechanisms for tokens and sensitive user preferences.
- **Dependency Security:**
    - **Regular Updates:** Keep all frontend libraries and dependencies updated to their latest secure versions.
    - **Vulnerability Scanning:** Integrate dependency vulnerability scanning into the CI/CD pipeline.

**Assumptions:**
- Backend API implements its own robust security measures (e.g., input validation, authentication, authorization).
- Developers are aware of common frontend security vulnerabilities and best practices.
