# Project Agents

This file provides guidance and memory for your coding CLI.

<!-- BEGIN: BMAD-AGENTS-OPENCODE -->
# BMAD-METHOD Agents and Tasks (OpenCode)

OpenCode reads AGENTS.md during initialization and uses it as part of its system prompt for the session. This section is auto-generated by BMAD-METHOD for OpenCode.

## How To Use With OpenCode

- Run `opencode` in this project. OpenCode will read `AGENTS.md` and your OpenCode config (opencode.json[c]).
- Reference a role naturally, e.g., "As dev, implement ..." or use commands defined in your BMAD tasks.
- Commit `.bmad-core` and `AGENTS.md` if you want teammates to share the same configuration.
- Refresh this section after BMAD updates: `npx bmad-method install -f -i opencode`.

### Helpful Commands

- List agents: `npx bmad-method list:agents`
- Reinstall BMAD core and regenerate this section: `npx bmad-method install -f -i opencode`
- Validate configuration: `npx bmad-method validate`

Note
- Orchestrators run as mode: primary; other agents as all.
- All agents have tools enabled: write, edit, bash.
