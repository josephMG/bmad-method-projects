# Story: Application Platform

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to use Flutter to build the application for both iOS and Android,
**so that** the application is available on both major mobile platforms.

## Description
Utilizing Flutter for cross-platform development offers significant advantages for this project. It enables extensive code reusability, meaning a single codebase can be maintained for both iOS and Android, drastically reducing development time and effort. This approach also ensures a consistent user interface and experience across both platforms, which is crucial for brand recognition and user satisfaction. This foundational work of establishing the Flutter platform is critical as it underpins all subsequent feature development, providing the framework upon which the entire Family Expense Tracker application will be built.

## Acceptance Criteria
-   The application successfully builds and runs on a specified range of iOS devices/simulators (e.g., iOS 15+).
-   The application successfully builds and runs on a specified range of Android devices/emulators (e.g., Android 10+).
-   A single, unified codebase is used for both iOS and Android platforms.
-   Basic UI elements (e.g., text, buttons, navigation bar) render correctly and consistently on both platforms.
-   The development environment is configured to support Flutter development for both platforms.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Initialize Flutter project (AC: 1, 2, 3, 5)
  - [ ] Run `flutter create family_expense_tracker`
- [ ] Configure `pubspec.yaml` with core dependencies (AC: 3, 5)
  - [ ] Add `http`, `provider`, `google_sign_in`, `googleapis_auth`, `googleapis`
  - [ ] Run `flutter pub get`
- [ ] Verify project builds for iOS (AC: 1, 5)
  - [ ] Run `flutter build ios`
- [ ] Verify project builds for Android (AC: 2, 5)
  - [ ] Run `flutter build apk` or `flutter build appbundle`
- [ ] Run on iOS simulator/device (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Verify basic UI elements render correctly
- [ ] Run on Android emulator/device (AC: 2, 4)
  - [ ] Verify basic UI elements render correctly

## Dev Notes
### General
This story establishes the foundational Flutter project setup for cross-platform development. The primary goal is to ensure the project can be built and run on both iOS and Android from a single codebase, providing a consistent user experience.

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- `pubspec.yaml`: This file will be modified to include all necessary Flutter and Dart package dependencies.
- `lib/main.dart`: The entry point for the Flutter application, where initial UI rendering will be verified.
- `ios/Runner.xcodeproj` and `android/app/build.gradle`: Platform-specific project files that will be implicitly configured by `flutter create` and `flutter pub get`.

### Testing
- **Test file location:** Basic verification will involve running the application on emulators/devices. Formal unit/widget/integration tests will be added in later stories.
- **Test standards:** For this story, manual verification of successful builds and basic UI rendering on target platforms is sufficient.
- **Testing frameworks and patterns to use:** N/A for this foundational story.
- **Any specific testing requirements for this story:** Ensure the application launches without crashes on at least one iOS simulator/device and one Android emulator/device. Verify that a simple `Text` widget and `AppBar` are visible.
