# Story: Google Sheet Sync

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** the application to automatically load categories and the current month's expense data from Google Sheets on startup, and be able to manually refresh the data to sync any changes made directly in the spreadsheet,
**so that** my in-app view is always consistent with the central Google Sheet data.

## Description
This story focuses on establishing a robust synchronization mechanism between the Flutter application and Google Sheets. Upon application startup, the system will automatically initiate a data load process. This process will first fetch all defined categories from the dedicated 'Category' tab within the linked Google Sheet. Subsequently, it will retrieve the current month's expense data from its corresponding `YYYY-MM` tab (e.g., `2025-10`). This initial load ensures that the user's in-app view is immediately populated with the most up-to-date information from the central data source.

Beyond the initial startup sync, users will have the ability to manually trigger a data refresh. This manual refresh capability is crucial for scenarios where users might have directly edited the Google Sheet outside of the application. A dedicated user interface element (e.g., a pull-to-refresh gesture on relevant screens or a clearly labeled refresh button) will allow users to explicitly request the application to re-fetch all categories and the current month's expense data from Google Sheets.

Maintaining data consistency between the application and the Google Sheet is paramount. The application will provide clear visual feedback to the user during any synchronization operation, indicating that data is being fetched and processed (e.g., "Syncing...", loading spinners). Furthermore, robust error handling will be implemented to gracefully manage network connectivity issues or Google Sheets API errors, presenting informative messages to the user rather than failing silently. It is important to note that while this story establishes the foundation for data synchronization, automatic background synchronization and a comprehensive offline mode with eventual consistency are acknowledged as future enhancements.

## Acceptance Criteria
-   Upon application startup, categories from the 'Category' Google Sheet tab are automatically loaded and displayed.
-   Upon application startup, the current month's expense data from its `YYYY-MM` Google Sheet tab is automatically loaded and displayed.
-   Users can trigger a manual refresh (e.g., via a pull-to-refresh gesture or a dedicated button) to re-fetch all data from Google Sheets.
-   After a manual refresh, the application's display accurately reflects any changes made directly in the Google Sheet.
-   The application provides visual feedback to the user during synchronization (e.g., 'Syncing...', loading indicators).
-   The application gracefully handles network errors or Google Sheets API errors during sync operations, providing informative messages.
-   (Future consideration) A robust offline mode with eventual consistency is implemented.
-   (Future consideration) Automatic background synchronization is implemented.

## Dev Notes
### General
This story establishes the core data synchronization mechanism between the Flutter application and Google Sheets. It covers automatic loading on startup and manual refresh capabilities. Key considerations include performance, conflict resolution (initial version prioritizes Google Sheet data), and user experience for sync indicators and error messages.

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- `lib/services/google_sheets_service.dart`: Extend with methods for reading categories and monthly expense data.
- `lib/providers/category_provider.dart`: State management for categories.
- `lib/providers/expense_provider.dart`: State management for expense records.
- `lib/screens/home_screen.dart` or similar: UI for displaying data and refresh mechanism.

### Testing
- **Test file location:** `test/services/google_sheets_service_test.dart`, `test/providers/category_provider_test.dart`, `test/providers/expense_provider_test.dart`, `test/screens/home_screen_test.dart`.
- **Test standards:** Unit tests for data loading logic, integration tests for API interactions (mocked), widget tests for UI components (refresh, indicators).
- **Testing frameworks and patterns to use:** `flutter_test`, `mockito` for mocking API responses and dependencies.
- **Any specific testing requirements for this story:**
  - Verify automatic loading of categories and expense data on app startup.
  - Test manual refresh functionality, ensuring data consistency.
  - Verify visual feedback (loading indicators, messages) during sync.
  - Test error handling for network disconnections and Google Sheets API failures.
