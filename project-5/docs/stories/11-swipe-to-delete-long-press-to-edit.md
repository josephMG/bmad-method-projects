## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to easily delete expense records by swiping and edit them by long-pressing,
**so that** I can efficiently manage my expense list.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  Users can swipe left or right on an expense record in the list to reveal a delete action.
2.  Tapping the delete action triggers a confirmation dialog asking "Are you sure you want to delete this expense?".
3.  Confirming the deletion removes the expense record from the UI and updates the corresponding Google Sheet.
4.  Canceling the deletion dismisses the dialog and keeps the expense record in the list.
5.  Users can long-press on an expense record in the list to open an edit form/dialog.
6.  The edit form/dialog pre-populates with the existing expense record details.
7.  Users can modify the expense details (Date, Name, Category, Amount) in the edit form/dialog.
8.  Saving changes in the edit form/dialog updates the expense record in the UI and the corresponding Google Sheet.
9.  Canceling the edit form/dialog dismisses it without saving changes.
10. Clear visual feedback is provided for successful deletions and edits.

## Dev Notes

- **Previous Story Insights**: This story builds upon the "Expense List UI" (Story 7) and "Expense Record Data Model & CRUD Operations" (Story 6). Ensure that the unique `RecordID` generated in Story 6 is utilized for reliable update and delete operations.
- **Data Models**: The `ExpenseRecord` data model defined in Story 6 will be used. It should include `Date`, `Name`, `Category`, `Amount`, and `RecordID`. [Source: docs/prd/family-expense-tracker-prd.md#2.4-expense-record-format, docs/prd/family-expense-tracker-prd.md#5.2-suggested-improvements-additional-fields]
- **API Specifications**: The CRUD operations (specifically Delete and Update) implemented in Story 6 for interacting with the Google Sheets API will be leveraged. These operations require the `RecordID` for targeting specific expense records. [Source: docs/prd/family-expense-tracker-prd.md#2.4-expense-record-format, docs/prd/family-expense-tracker-prd.md#3-google-sheets-api-client-data-layer]
- **Component Specifications**: The expense list items developed in Story 7 will need to be enhanced to support swipe gestures and long-press events. The edit form/dialog should adhere to Material 3 design guidelines. [Source: docs/prd/family-expense-tracker-prd.md#2.5-expense-list, docs/prd/family-expense-tracker-prd.md#4-uiux-material-3]
- **File Locations**: UI components related to swipe-to-delete and long-press-to-edit will likely reside within `lib/features/expense_list/presentation/widgets/`. The edit form/dialog could be a new widget like `edit_expense_dialog.dart` within the same directory. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- **Error Handling**: For delete and edit operations, implement robust error handling as per the overall error handling strategy (Task 11 in PRD). This includes displaying clear, user-friendly error messages for network issues or API failures during these operations. [Source: docs/prd/family-expense-tracker-prd.md#11-error-handling-user-feedback]
- **Testing Requirements**: Unit tests should cover the logic for handling gestures and API calls. Widget tests should verify the UI interactions for swiping, long-pressing, confirmation dialogs, and the edit form/dialog. [Source: docs/prd/family-expense-tracker-prd.md#3-non-functional-requirements, docs/prd/family-expense-tracker-prd.md#13-unit-widget-testing]
- **Technical Constraints**: Ensure smooth UI transitions and responsiveness for both swipe and long-press interactions. [Source: docs/prd/family-expense-tracker-prd.md#3-non-functional-requirements]

- All ACs Met: ✓ (All Acceptance Criteria are met)

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] **Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows**: To ensure the complete user experience, end-to-end tests covering adding, editing, and deleting expenses through the UI would be beneficial. (suggested_owner: dev)
- [ ] **Explicitly mention accessibility considerations**: Ensure accessibility for swipe and long-press gestures is considered and documented. (suggested_owner: ux-expert)

### Security Review

Security considerations for CRUD operations on financial data are handled through integration with existing secure services (e.g., Google Sheets API with OAuth).

### Performance Considerations

Ensure smooth UI transitions and responsiveness for both swipe and long-press interactions, especially for potentially long lists.
