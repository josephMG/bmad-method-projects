## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to easily navigate between different months using a dedicated UI component, including moving to the previous/next month or jumping to a specific month,
**so that** I can effortlessly review historical expense data.

## Description
The month navigator UI component will provide intuitive controls for users to move between months. This includes 'previous' and 'next' buttons to navigate to adjacent months. Additionally, a month picker component (e.g., a calendar or a dropdown with month/year selection) will allow users to directly jump to any specific month and year. When a new month is selected, the application will seamlessly load and display the expense data from the corresponding `YYYY-MM` Google Sheet tab, ensuring a smooth and efficient experience for reviewing historical financial information. The currently selected month will always be clearly indicated within the UI.

## Acceptance Criteria
-   A dedicated month navigator UI component is present on the expense list screen.
-   Users can tap 'previous' and 'next' buttons to navigate to the adjacent months.
-   Users can open a month picker (e.g., calendar or dropdown) to directly select any specific month and year.
-   Upon selecting a new month, the application automatically loads and displays the expense data from the corresponding `YYYY-MM` Google Sheet tab.
-   The currently selected month is clearly indicated in the UI.
-   (Future consideration) A button or gesture allows users to quickly return to the current month.

## Tasks / Subtasks

  - [x] Call Google Sheets API to load data from `YYYY-MM` tab
- [x] Implement logic to ensure the application automatically loads and displays expense data upon month selection (AC: 4)
- [x] Implement missing widget tests for `ExpenseListPage` month navigation interactions
- [x] Address critical issues identified in PO validation (rollback procedures, environment setup, API limits, developer documentation)

## Dev Notes
### General
This story focuses on implementing a user-friendly month navigation system. Key considerations include the design of the month picker for optimal usability on mobile devices, performance of data loading when switching months, and localization of month/year names.

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- `lib/widgets/month_navigator.dart`: New UI component for month navigation.
- `lib/providers/month_provider.dart`: New state management for the currently selected month.
- `lib/services/google_sheets_service.dart`: Extend with methods to fetch data for a specific `YYYY-MM` tab.
- `lib/screens/expense_list_screen.dart`: Integrate the month navigator and update expense display based on selected month.

### Testing
- **Test file location:** `test/widgets/month_navigator_test.dart`, `test/providers/month_provider_test.dart`, `test/screens/expense_list_screen_test.dart`.
- **Test standards:** Unit tests for month navigation logic. Widget tests for UI component interactions (button taps, picker selection). Integration tests for data loading upon month change (mocking Google Sheets API).
- **Testing frameworks and patterns to use:** `flutter_test`, `mockito` for mocking dependencies.
- **Any specific testing requirements for this story:**
  - Verify correct display of the current month.
  - Test navigation to previous and next months.
  - Test selection of a specific month from the picker.
  - Confirm that expense data updates correctly after month selection.
  - Verify UI responsiveness and accessibility for the month picker.
