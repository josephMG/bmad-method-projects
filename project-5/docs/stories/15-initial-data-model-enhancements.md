## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to enhance the expense record data model in Google Sheets with hidden columns for `RecordID`, `RecordedBy`, `CreatedAt`, and `LastModified`,
**so that** each expense record has unique identifiers and audit trails for reliable data management and future scalability.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. When a new expense record is added via the application, a unique `RecordID` (UUID) is generated and stored in a hidden column in the corresponding monthly Google Sheet tab.
2. When a new expense record is added via the application, the `RecordedBy` field (Google User ID or Name) is captured and stored in a hidden column.
3. When a new expense record is added via the application, the `CreatedAt` timestamp is automatically generated and stored in a hidden column.
4. When an existing expense record is modified via the application, the `LastModified` timestamp is automatically updated and stored in a hidden column.
5. The `RecordID`, `RecordedBy`, `CreatedAt`, and `LastModified` columns are hidden from direct user view in Google Sheets.
6. The application's data layer correctly reads and writes these hidden column values without exposing them in the UI.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Update `ExpenseRecord` Data Model (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)**
  - [x] Modify `ExpenseRecord` data class to include `RecordID` (String), `RecordedBy` (String), `CreatedAt` (DateTime), `LastModified` (DateTime).
  - [x] Implement UUID generation for `RecordID` when creating a new `ExpenseRecord`.
  - [x] Implement logic to set `CreatedAt` on new record creation and `LastModified` on record modification.
- [x] **Modify `GoogleSheetsService` for Hidden Columns (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)**
  - [x] Update methods for adding new expense records to include `RecordID`, `RecordedBy`, `CreatedAt`, `LastModified` in the data sent to Google Sheets.
  - [x] Update methods for modifying expense records to update `LastModified` in Google Sheets.
  - [x] Ensure that when reading data from Google Sheets, these columns are correctly parsed into the `ExpenseRecord` model.
  - [x] Implement logic (if necessary via API) to ensure these columns are hidden in Google Sheets. (Initial approach: rely on the app not displaying them).
- [x] **Update `ExpenseRepository` (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)**
  - [x] Adjust `addExpense` method to generate `RecordID`, `CreatedAt`, and `RecordedBy` before calling `GoogleSheetsService`.
  - [x] Adjust `updateExpense` method to update `LastModified` before calling `GoogleSheetsService`.
  - [x] Ensure `getExpensesForMonth` correctly retrieves all fields, including the new hidden ones.
- [x] **UI Layer (AC: 6)**
  - [x] Verify that the UI does not display `RecordID`, `RecordedBy`, `CreatedAt`, `LastModified` to the user.
- [x] **Unit Tests (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4)**
  - [x] Write unit tests for `ExpenseRecord` model serialization/deserialization.
  - [x] Write unit tests for `ExpenseRepository` to verify correct handling of new fields during CRUD operations.
- [x] **Integration Tests (AC: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)**
  - [x] Create integration tests to confirm end-to-end flow of adding and modifying expenses, verifying that hidden columns are correctly persisted and retrieved from Google Sheets.

## Dev Notes

- **Data Models:**
  - `ExpenseRecord` data class in Flutter should be updated to include fields for `RecordID` (UUID), `RecordedBy` (String), `CreatedAt` (Timestamp), and `LastModified` (Timestamp). [Source: docs/architecture/family-expense-tracker-architecture.md#models-layer, docs/prd/family-expense-tracker-prd.md#worksheet-yyyy-mm]
  - `RecordID` is critical for reliable update and delete operations. It should be generated by the app (UUID). [Source: docs/prd/family-expense-tracker-prd.md#worksheet-yyyy-mm, docs/architecture/family-expense-tracker-architecture.md#scalability-and-future-proofing]
  - `RecordedBy` should capture the Google User ID or Name of the user who added the expense. [Source: docs/prd/family-expense-tracker-prd.md#worksheet-yyyy-mm]
  - `CreatedAt` and `LastModified` are timestamps for auditing and conflict resolution. `CreatedAt` is set on creation, `LastModified` is updated on modification. [Source: docs/prd/family-expense-tracker-prd.md#worksheet-yyyy-mm]

- **API Specifications:**
  - The `GoogleSheetsService` and `ExpenseRepository` will need to be updated to handle the reading and writing of these new hidden columns when interacting with the Google Sheets API. [Source: docs/architecture/family-expense-tracker-architecture.md#service-layer, docs/architecture/family-expense-tracker-architecture.md#data-layer-repository-pattern]
  - When appending new rows, ensure these fields are included. When updating rows, ensure `LastModified` is updated.
  - The mechanism for "hiding" columns in Google Sheets typically involves setting their visibility property via the Google Sheets API, or simply placing them in columns that are not displayed by the application's UI. For this story, the focus is on the data layer handling these fields, and the application UI not displaying them.

- **File Locations:**
  - `lib/features/expense/data/models/expense_record.dart` (or similar, based on project structure) for the `ExpenseRecord` data class.
  - `lib/features/expense/data/repositories/expense_repository.dart` (and its implementation) for CRUD operations.
  - `lib/services/google_sheets_service.dart` (or similar) for low-level Google Sheets API interaction.

- **Testing:**
  - Unit tests for the `ExpenseRecord` data model to ensure correct serialization/deserialization.
  - Unit tests for `ExpenseRepository` methods to verify that `RecordID`, `RecordedBy`, `CreatedAt`, and `LastModified` are correctly generated, stored, and retrieved.
  - Integration tests to confirm that these hidden columns are correctly handled during end-to-end expense creation and modification flows with Google Sheets.

- **Technical Constraints:**
  - Ensure UUID generation is robust and unique.
  - Timestamp generation should use UTC.
  - The application should not display these hidden columns in any user-facing UI.
