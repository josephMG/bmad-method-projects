## Story
**As a** developer,
**I want** to have comprehensive unit and widget tests for the application,
**so that** I can ensure code quality, prevent regressions, and facilitate future development.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Unit tests are written for all data models (`ExpenseRecord`, `Category`).
2. Unit tests are written for all services (`AuthService`, `GoogleSheetsService`).
3. Unit tests are written for state management logic (Riverpod/Provider providers).
4. Widget tests are written for key UI components (e.g., Expense List, Month Navigator, Category Management UI).
5. Tests adhere to the defined coding standards and testing guidelines.
6. Test coverage focuses on critical paths and complex logic.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Define a clear testing strategy and framework for unit and widget tests.
    - [x] Research and select appropriate mocking libraries for Flutter/Dart. (Note: `mockito` is already in use and will be continued.)
- [x] Implement unit tests for `ExpenseRecord` data model.
- [x] Implement unit tests for `Category` data model.
- [x] Implement unit tests for `AuthService`.
- [x] Implement unit tests for `GoogleSheetsService`.
- [x] Implement unit tests for `ExpenseRepository` and `CategoryRepository` implementations.
- [x] Implement unit tests for Riverpod/Provider state management logic (e.g., providers for expense list, categories).
- [x] Implement widget tests for the Expense List UI component.
- [x] Implement widget tests for the Month Navigation UI component.
- [x] Implement widget tests for Category Management UI components.
- [x] Ensure all tests are runnable and pass consistently.
- [ ] Integrate tests into the CI/CD pipeline (future task, but consider test runner setup).

## Dev Notes

### Testing
*   **Test file location:**
    *   Unit Tests: Located in `test/unit/` or alongside the code they test (e.g., `lib/data/models/expense_test.dart`). [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#3]
    *   Widget Tests: Located in `test/widget/` or within the `presentation` layer's `test` subfolder. [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#3]
*   **Test standards:**
    *   Write unit tests for business logic, data models, and services. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#7]
    *   Write widget tests for UI components. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#7]
    *   Aim for good test coverage, focusing on critical paths and complex logic. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#7]
    *   Design code to be easily testable. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#1]
*   **Testing frameworks and patterns to use:**
    *   Riverpod (preferred) offers compile-time safety, easy testing, and a clear dependency graph. [Source: architecture/family-expense-tracker-architecture.md#4]
    *   Use Riverpod's provider system for dependency injection, which aids testability. [Source: architecture/coding-standards.md#3]
*   **Specific testing requirements for this story:**
    *   Test data models (`ExpenseRecord`, `Category`). [Source: PRD, architecture/family-expense-tracker-architecture.md#3]
    *   Test services (`AuthService`, `GoogleSheetsService`). [Source: PRD, architecture/family-expense-tracker-architecture.md#3]
    *   Test state management logic (Riverpod/Provider providers). [Source: PRD, architecture/family-expense-tracker-architecture.md#3]
    *   Test key UI components (Expense List, Month Navigator, Category Management UI). [Source: PRD, architecture/family-expense-tracker-architecture.md#3]

**Project Structure Notes:**
*   The `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md` file was not found. This document would typically provide more detailed guidance on testing strategies, tools, and coverage expectations. The developer should be aware of this missing context and rely on the `coding-standards.md` and `source-tree.md` for testing guidance.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-23

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The implementation appears to follow the architectural guidelines for test structure and state management (Riverpod, repository pattern). A full code review would still be necessary to confirm adherence to coding standards, identify refactoring opportunities, and assess performance/security aspects.

### Refactoring Performed

None. (Cannot perform active refactoring without code access.)

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ (Cannot verify without code access)
- Project Structure: ✓ (File list aligns with `source-tree.md`)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (The `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md` file has been created and provides comprehensive guidance.)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (Based on provided file list and task completion, all ACs appear to be covered by tests.)

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Conduct a full code review to verify adherence to coding standards, identify refactoring opportunities, and assess performance/security aspects.

### Security Review

The story involves authentication and data services. While tests are present and the `testing-strategy.md` addresses error handling, a detailed security review of the code is necessary to ensure secure Google OAuth handling and data transmission.

### Performance Considerations

The story does not explicitly address performance testing.

### Files Modified During Review

None.
