## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to sign in to the application using my Google account,
**so that** I can easily and securely access my data without needing to create a new account or remember another password.

## Description

Google OAuth integration is crucial for enhancing user convenience and bolstering security within the application. By allowing users to sign in with their existing Google accounts, we significantly streamline the onboarding process, eliminating the need for new account creation and the burden of remembering yet another password. This approach leverages Google's robust authentication infrastructure, providing a familiar and trusted sign-in experience. Furthermore, it ensures the secure handling of user data and authentication tokens, adhering to industry best practices for data protection and privacy.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can successfully initiate Google Sign-In from the application.
- Upon successful authentication, the user's Google profile information (e.g., name, email) is securely retrieved and accessible by the application.
- Authentication tokens are securely stored and refreshed automatically to maintain user sessions.
- The application gracefully handles sign-in failures (e.g., network issues, user cancellation).
- Users can sign out of their Google account from within the application.
- The Google Cloud Console project is configured with the necessary OAuth 2.0 client IDs for iOS and Android.

## Dev Notes

### General

This story focuses on integrating Google OAuth for user authentication. The primary goal is to provide a secure and convenient sign-in experience, leveraging existing Google accounts. Secure handling of tokens and robust error management are critical.

### Relevant Source Tree Info

- `pubspec.yaml`: Will include `google_sign_in`, `flutter_riverpod`.
- `lib/features/authentication/data/auth_repository.dart`: New service to encapsulate Google Sign-In logic.
- `lib/presentation/pages/authentication_page.dart`: New UI for the sign-in process.
- `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`, `android/app/google-services.json`: Platform-specific configuration files.

### Testing

- **Test file location:** `test/widget_test.dart` (updated for authentication page).
- **Test standards:** Unit tests for `AuthRepository` methods (mocking `google_sign_in`). Widget tests for the sign-in UI. Integration tests for end-to-end sign-in/sign-out flow on emulators/devices.
- **Testing frameworks and patterns to use:** `flutter_test`, `mockito` for mocking `GoogleSignIn` and `GoogleSignInAccount`.
- **Any specific testing requirements for this story:**
  - Verify successful sign-in and retrieval of user info.
  - Test sign-out functionality.
  - Test token storage and refresh (simulated).
  - Test error scenarios: network loss during sign-in, user cancellation, invalid credentials.
  - Verify correct configuration for both iOS and Android.

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Gemini

### Debug Log References

- `flutter test` output: (All tests passed)

### Completion Notes List

- **Fixed all outstanding test failures.** The previous implementation suffered from fragile, hand-written mocks that caused persistent null-safety and stubbing errors in unit, widget, and integration tests.
- **Refactored all test files (`auth_repository_test.dart`, `widget_test.dart`, `google_auth_integration_test.dart`) to use robust, code-generated mocks.**
- Added `build_runner` to `dev_dependencies` to enable mock generation.
- Used `@GenerateMocks` annotation to create mock classes for `GoogleSignIn`, `GoogleSignInAccount`, `GoogleSignInAuthentication`, and `AuthRepository`.
- Corrected invalid import paths in integration tests.
- All unit, widget, and integration tests now pass successfully, ensuring the authentication feature is stable and well-tested.
