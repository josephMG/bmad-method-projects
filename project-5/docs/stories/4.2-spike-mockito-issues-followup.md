# Story: Follow-up on Mockito Spike Improvements

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** development team,
**I want** to ensure that the recommendations from the `mockito` spike (Story 4) are actioned,
**so that** we can unblock the `deleteExpense` functionality and maintain a stable testing environment.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A new spike story (Story 4.1) to upgrade `mockito` and `build_runner` is created and approved.
- [ ] The `deleteExpense` feature story (Story 5) is revisited by the Product Owner after the `mockito` upgrade spike is complete.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Verify Story 4.1 creation and approval**
    - [ ] Confirm that Story 4.1: Technical Spike - Upgrade Mockito and Build Runner exists and is in an 'Approved' status.
- [x] **Monitor Story 4.1 completion**
    - [ ] Track the progress of Story 4.1 to ensure the `mockito` upgrade is completed.
- [x] **Notify Product Owner to revisit Story 5**
    - [ ] Once Story 4.1 is 'Done', inform the Product Owner to re-evaluate and prioritize Story 5: Implement Delete Expense Functionality.
