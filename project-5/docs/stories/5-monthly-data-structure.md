# Story: Monthly Data Structure

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** Family Member,
**I want** the system to automatically create and manage monthly Google Sheet tabs (named `YYYY-MM`) for my expense records, including handling cases where a tab might be missing,
**so that** my financial data is always organized, accurate, and easily accessible by month.

## Description
The application will ensure that expense data is logically organized into monthly tabs within Google Sheets. When a user navigates to a month for which a `YYYY-MM` tab does not exist, the application will automatically create a new tab with the correct naming convention (e.g., `2025-10` for October 2025). This structure is crucial for providing clear financial overviews and simplifying data retrieval by month. The system will also gracefully handle scenarios where a `YYYY-MM` tab might be unexpectedly missing or inaccessible, providing appropriate user feedback and potentially attempting to recreate it if permissions allow.

## Acceptance Criteria
-   When a user navigates to a month for which a `YYYY-MM` Google Sheet tab does not exist, the application automatically creates a new tab with the correct naming convention.
-   The application successfully reads and displays expense records from the corresponding `YYYY-MM` tab for the selected month.
-   The application gracefully handles scenarios where a `YYYY-MM` tab is deleted or renamed in Google Sheets, providing appropriate user feedback.
-   The data displayed in the application accurately reflects the contents of the active `YYYY-MM` Google Sheet tab.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [ ] Implement Google Sheets API client for creating new tabs (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Define API call to create a new sheet tab with `YYYY-MM` naming convention
  - [ ] Handle API authentication and error responses
- [ ] Implement logic to check for existence of `YYYY-MM` tab upon month navigation (AC: 1)
- [ ] Implement logic to automatically create `YYYY-MM` tab if it does not exist (AC: 1)
- [ ] Implement logic to successfully read and display expense records from the corresponding `YYYY-MM` tab (AC: 2)
- [ ] Implement graceful handling for deleted or renamed `YYYY-MM` tabs (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Provide appropriate user feedback
  - [ ] (Consideration) Attempt to recreate tab if permissions allow
- [ ] Implement logic to ensure data displayed accurately reflects active `YYYY-MM` tab (AC: 4)

## Dev Notes
### General
This story focuses on the automatic creation and management of monthly Google Sheet tabs to organize expense data. Key considerations include permissions for creating new tabs, performance implications of frequent tab creation, and handling potential naming conflicts.

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- `lib/services/google_sheets_service.dart`: Extend with methods for checking tab existence, creating new tabs, and reading data from specific tabs.
- `lib/providers/month_provider.dart`: Integrate with logic for checking and creating tabs based on selected month.

### Testing
- **Test file location:** `test/services/google_sheets_service_test.dart`, `test/providers/month_provider_test.dart`.
- **Test standards:** Unit tests for tab existence checks, tab creation logic, and error handling for tab operations. Integration tests for reading data from specific `YYYY-MM` tabs (mocking Google Sheets API).
- **Testing frameworks and patterns to use:** `flutter_test`, `mockito` for mocking API responses and dependencies.
- **Any specific testing requirements for this story:**
  - Verify automatic creation of new `YYYY-MM` tabs when navigating to a non-existent month.
  - Test successful reading and display of expense records from the correct monthly tab.
  - Test graceful handling of deleted or renamed tabs, including user feedback.
  - Verify that the displayed data always matches the active Google Sheet tab.
  - Test permission handling for tab creation.
