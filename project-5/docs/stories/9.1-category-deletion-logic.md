## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** to prevent the accidental deletion of categories that are actively used in my expense records,
**so that** my expense data remains consistent and accurate.

## Acceptance Criteria
**Functional Requirements:**
1.  When a user attempts to delete a category, the application checks if the category is currently used in any existing expense records.
2.  If the category is used in existing expense records, the application prevents its deletion and informs the user.
3.  (Alternative) If the category is used, the application provides an option to reassign existing expenses to another category before deletion.

**Integration Requirements:**
4.  Existing category management functionality continues to work unchanged.
5.  Existing expense record management functionality continues to work unchanged.
6.  Integration with Google Sheets for category and expense data maintains current behavior.

**Quality Requirements:**
7.  Change is covered by appropriate tests.
8.  Documentation is updated if needed.
9.  No regression in existing functionality verified.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Implement logic to check for category usage in expense records.
- [x] Implement UI to prevent deletion or offer reassignment.
- [x] Implement reassignment logic (if chosen).
- [x] Write unit and integration tests for category deletion logic.
- [x] Verify existing category management functionality remains unchanged (AC 4).
- [x] Verify existing expense record management functionality remains unchanged (AC 5).
- [x] Verify Google Sheets integration for category and expense data maintains current behavior (AC 6).
- [x] Ensure documentation is updated if needed (AC 8).
- [x] Perform regression testing to ensure no regression in existing functionality (AC 9).

## Dev Notes
### General
This story addresses the referential integrity for category deletion, which was deferred from story 7. It requires checking existing expense records for category usage.

### Architectural Considerations
-   **Data Access:** Efficiently access and query expense records from Google Sheets.

### Error Handling Considerations
-   **API Call Failures:** Graceful handling of Google Sheets API errors during category usage checks and reassignment (e.g., network issues, permission errors, rate limits).
-   **Network Issues:** Inform the user about network connectivity problems.
-   **User Feedback:** Provide clear and actionable error messages to the user.
-   **Logging:** Log detailed error information for debugging.

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- `lib/data/models/category.dart`: Existing category model.
- `lib/data/models/expense.dart`: Existing or new expense record model.
- `lib/services/google_sheets_service.dart`: Existing service for Google Sheets API interactions.
- `lib/presentation/widgets/category_list.dart` or similar: UI component for category management.

### UI/UX Considerations
-   **Deletion Prevention UI:** A clear, non-dismissible alert or dialog box informing the user that the category cannot be deleted because it's in use, listing the number of associated expenses.
-   **Reassignment Option UI:** If reassignment is chosen, a modal dialog with a dropdown to select an existing category for reassignment.
-   **User Flow:**
    -   User attempts to delete Category A.
    -   System checks for associated expenses.
    -   If expenses exist:
        -   Display alert: "Category A is used in X expense records. You cannot delete it directly."
        -   Offer option: "Reassign expenses to another category?" (Yes/No)
        -   If "Yes": Show reassignment dialog.
        -   If "No": Cancel deletion.
    -   If no expenses exist: Proceed with deletion confirmation.
-   **Styling:** Adhere to Material 3 Design guidelines.
-   **Responsiveness:** Ensure UI elements are functional and visually appealing across various screen sizes.

### Testing
- **Test file location:** `test/data/models/expense_test.dart`, `test/services/google_sheets_service_test.dart`, `test/presentation/widgets/category_list_test.dart`.
- **Test standards:** Unit tests for category usage check logic. Integration tests for end-to-end deletion/reassignment flow.
- **Testing frameworks and patterns to use:** `flutter_test`, `mockito`.
- **Test Data Requirements:**
    -   Category with no associated expenses: For successful deletion.
    -   Category with associated expenses: For deletion prevention and reassignment scenarios.
    -   Multiple categories and expenses: To test reassignment to different categories.
    -   Edge cases: Empty expense list, single category, etc.

### Completion Notes List
- All functional and quality requirements for category deletion logic have been met.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

This story successfully implements the critical referential integrity logic for category deletion, preventing accidental data loss and ensuring data consistency. The implementation includes robust checks for category usage, UI for deletion prevention and reassignment, and comprehensive unit and integration tests. The refactoring of the `CategoryList` widget and its tests, along with the PRD update, demonstrate a high level of quality and attention to detail.

### Refactoring Performed

- `CategoryList` widget and its associated tests (`category_list_test.dart`) refactored and fixed.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (DoD Checklist confirms adherence)
- Project Structure: ✓ (DoD Checklist confirms adherence)
- Testing Strategy: ✓ (Comprehensive unit and integration tests implemented)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (All Acceptance Criteria are met)

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] **Consider adding end-to-end tests for category deletion and reassignment**: While unit and integration tests are comprehensive, an end-to-end test simulating actual API rate limits would provide higher confidence in the complete user experience. (suggested_owner: dev)

### Security Review

The implementation of referential integrity directly enhances data security by preventing unintended data loss or corruption. Robust error handling for API calls also contributes to overall system security.

### Performance Considerations

Efficient access and query of expense records from Google Sheets are architectural considerations, and the implementation should strive for optimal performance.
