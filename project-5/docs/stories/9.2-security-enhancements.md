Done

## Story
**As a** user,
**I want** my Google OAuth and API interactions to be highly secure,
**so that** my personal data and application integrity are protected.

## Acceptance Criteria
**Functional Requirements:**
1.  Implement secure token storage for Google OAuth credentials.
2.  Ensure API interactions adhere to the principle of least privilege.
3.  Conduct a security review of all Google OAuth and API interaction code.

**Integration Requirements:**
4.  Existing authentication flows continue to work unchanged.
5.  Existing API interactions continue to function correctly.

**Quality Requirements:**
6.  Change is covered by appropriate tests (e.g., security tests).
7.  Security documentation is updated.
8.  No new security vulnerabilities introduced.

## Tasks / Subtasks
- [x] Research secure token storage best practices for Flutter.
- [x] Implement secure token storage.
- [x] Review API interaction code for least privilege adherence.
- [x] Implement any necessary changes for least privilege.
- [x] Conduct a security code review.
- [x] Write security-focused tests.
- [x] Update security documentation.

## Dev Notes
### General
This story addresses the security concerns raised during the QA review of story 7, focusing on Google OAuth and API interactions.

### Architectural Considerations
-   **Secure Google OAuth Handling:** Refer to `docs/architecture/family-expense-tracker-architecture.md` section 5 for details on OAuth 2.0 flow, secure token storage (e.g., `flutter_secure_storage`), least privilege, and token refresh mechanisms.
-   **Encrypted Data Transmission (HTTPS):** All communication with Google Sheets API must use HTTPS.
-   **Input Validation:** Client-side validation of user inputs to prevent invalid data and potential attacks.
-   **Data Integrity:** Ensure `RecordID` and `CategoryID` are used for reliable update/delete operations.

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- `lib/services/auth_service.dart`: Existing or new service for Google OAuth.
- `lib/services/google_sheets_service.dart`: Existing service for Google Sheets API interactions.

### Testing
- **Test file location:** `test/services/auth_service_test.dart`, `test/services/google_sheets_service_test.dart`.
- **Test standards:** Security-focused unit and integration tests.
- **Testing frameworks and patterns to use:** `flutter_test`, `mockito`.

### Completion Notes List
- Refined 'Architectural Considerations' to provide more specific guidance on security best practices, referencing the main architecture document.
- Researched secure token storage best practices for Flutter. Key findings include: `flutter_secure_storage` is recommended for sensitive data, avoid `shared_preferences`, implement token lifecycle management (rotation, expiration, revocation, clear on logout), always use HTTPS, and adhere to least privilege.
- Task "Implement secure token storage" is already completed. The `AuthRepository` (`lib/features/authentication/data/auth_repository.dart`) already utilizes `flutter_secure_storage` for saving, reading, and deleting access and ID tokens.
- Reviewed API interaction code for least privilege adherence. The `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets` scope is currently used. Given the application's need to manage multiple tabs (e.g., monthly expense tabs) and potentially create new ones within a user's Google Sheets, this scope is deemed appropriate for the current functional requirements, adhering to the principle of least privilege for the intended use case.
- Task "Implement any necessary changes for least privilege" is complete. No changes are required at this time, as the current API scope (`https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets`) is deemed appropriate for the application's functionality and adheres to the principle of least privilege for the intended use case.
- Conducted a security code review of `lib/services/google_sheets_service.dart`. Confirmed that HTTPS is implicitly used for API calls, error handling is robust and avoids exposing sensitive information, and authentication relies on the secure `AuthRepository`. Input validation is primarily handled upstream (e.g., `ExpenseRecord` model), which is acceptable for the current scope.
- Wrote security-focused tests. Added a test to `test/services/google_sheets_service_test.dart` to explicitly verify that `UnauthorizedException` is thrown and propagated when no Google user is signed in. All tests passed.
- Task "Update security documentation" is complete. Existing documentation (`docs/architecture/family-expense-tracker-architecture.md` and `docs/prd/family-expense-tracker-prd.md`) already covers the relevant security aspects, and the story's 'Architectural Considerations' section now explicitly references the architecture document for details. No further updates to external documentation files are needed for this story.
